## Production Readiness Activities

### Documentation Creation
- **User Documentation**: Complete feature guides and tutorials
- **Developer Documentation**: API documentation and integration guides
- **Support Documentation**: Troubleshooting guides and common issues
- **Operations Documentation**: Deployment and monitoring procedures
- **Training Materials**: Internal team training resources

### Monitoring Setup
```yaml
# Example monitoring configuration for AI search
monitoring:
  alerts:
    - name: "AI Search High Error Rate"
      condition: "error_rate > 5%"
      duration: "5m"
      action: "notify_dev_team"

    - name: "AI Search Slow Response"
      condition: "response_time_p95 > 30s"
      duration: "10m"
      action: "notify_dev_team"

    - name: "External AI Service Cost Spike"
      condition: "daily_cost > budget * 1.2"
      duration: "1h"
      action: "notify_product_team"

  dashboards:
    - name: "AI Search Performance"
      metrics: ["response_time", "throughput", "error_rate"]
    - name: "AI Search Usage"
      metrics: ["daily_searches", "unique_users", "success_rate"]
    - name: "External AI Service Costs"
      metrics: ["daily_cost", "cost_per_search", "api_usage"]
```

### Feature Flag Configuration
```javascript
// Example feature flag configuration
const featureFlags = {
  'ai-search-enabled': {
    enabled: false,
    rolloutPercentage: 0,
    userSegments: ['internal-users'],
    description: 'Enable AI-powered contact search'
  },
  'ai-search-advanced-options': {
    enabled: false,
    rolloutPercentage: 0,
    userSegments: ['beta-users'],
    description: 'Enable advanced AI search options'
  }
};
```
