**Features:**
- Overview of all maintenance metrics
- Recent alerts and notifications
- System status monitoring
- Quick action shortcuts
- Tabbed interface for different maintenance areas

### ContactOutcomeTracker
Interface for tracking and managing contact interaction outcomes (replies, coverage, bounces, opt-outs).

**Features:**
- Record contact outcomes with detailed metadata
- View outcome statistics and trends
- Filter and search outcomes
- Track campaign performance
- Export outcome data

**Key Metrics:**
- Reply rates and trends
- Coverage rates
- Bounce rates
- Opt-out rates
- Campaign effectiveness

### WatchlistManager
Interface for managing watchlists of contacts and outlets that require special monitoring.

**Features:**
- Add contacts/outlets to watchlist
- Configure monitoring parameters
- View and manage alerts
- Set priority levels and alert frequencies
- Bulk watchlist operations

**Monitoring Types:**
- Contact moves and job changes
- Policy changes at outlets
- Activity level changes
- All changes (comprehensive monitoring)

### PolicyAlerts
Interface for monitoring and managing outlet policy changes that could affect contact strategies.

**Features:**
- View detected policy changes
- Verify or mark as false positive
- Configure monitoring settings
- Track policy change history
- Impact assessment for contacts

**Policy Types Monitored:**
- Contact policies
- Submission guidelines
- Embargo policies
- Press release policies

### MoveDetection
Interface for managing contact job changes and outlet moves detected by the automated system.

**Features:**
- Review detected contact moves
- Confirm or reject move detections
- Apply recommended actions
- Configure detection settings
- View move history and patterns

**Detection Methods:**
- Byline analysis
- Email tracking
- Social media monitoring
- Manual reporting

## Usage

### Basic Integration

```tsx
import { MaintenanceDashboard } from '@/components/features/maintenance';

export default function MaintenancePage() {
  return <MaintenanceDashboard />;
}
```

### Individual Components

```tsx
import { 
  ContactOutcomeTracker,
  WatchlistManager,
  PolicyAlerts,
  MoveDetection 
} from '@/components/features/maintenance';

// Use individual components as needed
export function OutcomesPage() {
  return <ContactOutcomeTracker />;
}
```

## Data Flow

### Contact Outcomes
1. User records outcome through interface
2. Outcome stored with metadata and campaign association
3. Statistics updated in real-time
4. Trends calculated for reporting

### Watchlist Management
1. User adds contact/outlet to watchlist
2. Monitoring system checks for changes
3. Alerts generated when changes detected
4. User reviews and manages alerts

### Policy Monitoring
1. System monitors outlet pages for changes
2. Changes detected and flagged for review
3. User verifies changes and updates contact strategies
4. Impact assessment performed on affected contacts

### Move Detection
1. System analyzes bylines, emails, and social media
2. Potential moves detected and scored
3. User reviews evidence and confirms/rejects
4. Contact records updated based on confirmed moves

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Maintenance system settings
MAINTENANCE_CHECK_FREQUENCY=daily
MAINTENANCE_ALERT_THRESHOLD=0.8
MAINTENANCE_AUTO_UPDATE_THRESHOLD=0.9

# Notification settings
MAINTENANCE_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS=true
MAINTENANCE_SLACK_NOTIFICATIONS=false
MAINTENANCE_DIGEST_FREQUENCY=weekly
```

### Feature Flags
```typescript
const maintenanceConfig = {
  outcomeTracking: true,
  watchlistMonitoring: true,
  policyMonitoring: true,
  moveDetection: true,
  autoUpdates: false, // Require manual confirmation
  realTimeAlerts: true
};
```

## API Integration

### Outcome Tracking
```typescript
// Record outcome
POST /api/maintenance/outcomes
{
  contactId: string;
  outcomeType: 'reply' | 'bounce' | 'coverage' | 'optout';
  status: 'positive' | 'negative' | 'neutral';
  details: string;
  metadata: object;
}

// Get outcome statistics
GET /api/maintenance/outcomes/stats
```

### Watchlist Management
```typescript
// Add to watchlist
POST /api/maintenance/watchlist
{
  type: 'contact' | 'outlet';
  entityId: string;
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  monitoringType: 'moves' | 'policy_changes' | 'activity' | 'all';
}

// Get watchlist alerts
GET /api/maintenance/watchlist/alerts
```

### Policy Monitoring
```typescript
// Get policy changes
GET /api/maintenance/policy-changes

// Update policy change status
PUT /api/maintenance/policy-changes/{id}
{
  status: 'verified' | 'false_positive' | 'acknowledged';
}
```

### Move Detection
```typescript
// Get detected moves
GET /api/maintenance/moves

// Confirm/reject move
PUT /api/maintenance/moves/{id}
{
  status: 'confirmed' | 'rejected';
  action?: 'update_contact' | 'create_new' | 'archive_old';
}
```

## Best Practices

### Outcome Tracking
- Record outcomes promptly after interactions
- Include detailed context in notes
- Associate outcomes with specific campaigns
- Review trends regularly to identify patterns

### Watchlist Management
- Use appropriate priority levels
- Set realistic alert frequencies
- Review and clean up inactive items
- Document reasons for watchlist inclusion

### Policy Monitoring
- Verify changes before taking action
- Assess impact on existing contacts
- Update contact strategies accordingly
- Maintain historical record of changes

### Move Detection
- Review evidence carefully before confirming
- Consider relationship strength in decisions
- Update contact records promptly
- Maintain continuity in communication

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**High false positive rate in move detection:**
- Adjust confidence threshold
- Review detection methods
- Improve training data quality

**Missing policy changes:**
- Check monitoring configuration
- Verify outlet URLs are accessible
- Review detection algorithms

**Watchlist alerts not triggering:**
- Confirm monitoring is active
- Check alert frequency settings
- Verify contact/outlet data is current

**Outcome tracking inconsistencies:**
- Standardize outcome recording process
- Train team on proper categorization
- Implement validation rules

### Performance Optimization

- Use pagination for large datasets
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Use background processing for heavy operations

## Security Considerations

- Implement proper access controls
- Audit all maintenance actions
- Protect sensitive contact information
- Secure API endpoints with authentication
- Log all system changes for compliance

## Future Enhancements
