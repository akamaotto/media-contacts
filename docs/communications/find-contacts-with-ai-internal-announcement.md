## Internal FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What makes this different from our existing search?**
A: "Find Contacts with AI" uses advanced natural language processing to understand the meaning and intent behind your queries, rather than just matching keywords. This delivers more relevant results and requires less complex query construction.

**Q: How does the AI work?**
A: The feature integrates with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter) to process natural language queries, enhance search terms, and score results for relevance. The system learns from usage patterns to continuously improve.

**Q: Is there an additional cost for this feature?**
A: The feature uses a credit-based system for AI processing costs. Internal testing has no cost limits, but we're monitoring usage to optimize the cost structure for customer pricing.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What happens if an AI provider is down?**
A: The system has built-in redundancy and will automatically failover to alternative providers. If all providers are unavailable, the system falls back to traditional search methods.

**Q: How are you protecting user data and privacy?**
A: All queries are processed securely, and personal data is encrypted. We don't store individual queries or share data with third parties beyond what's necessary for AI processing.

**Q: How do you ensure the quality of search results?**
A: We use multiple quality control mechanisms including result scoring, confidence thresholds, and human validation during the testing phase. User feedback is also incorporated to improve result quality.

### Launch Questions

**Q: Why are we doing a gradual rollout?**
A: Gradual rollout allows us to monitor performance, collect feedback, and address issues before exposing all users to the feature. This ensures a smooth experience and minimizes disruption.

**Q: What happens if we find major issues during testing?**
A: We have rollback procedures in place and can quickly disable the feature if critical issues are discovered. The gradual rollout approach minimizes the impact of potential problems.

**Q: How can I stay updated on the launch progress?**
A: Regular updates will be posted in #find-contacts-with-ai-updates. We'll also have weekly standup meetings during the launch period to discuss progress and address concerns.
