## Feature Overview

### Q: What exactly is "Find Contacts with AI"?
A: Find Contacts with AI is an intelligent search feature that uses artificial intelligence to understand natural language queries and discover relevant media contacts. It combines multiple AI services with sophisticated query processing to provide users with precise contact discovery, going beyond simple keyword matching to understand user intent.

### Q: How does it differ from regular search?
A: Regular search uses keyword matching and basic filters, while Find Contacts with AI uses natural language processing to understand the context and intent of queries. It also actively extracts contact information from web content in real-time, validates contact details, and provides confidence scores for each contact.

### Q: What are the main components of the system?
A: The system consists of four main components:
1. **Search Orchestration Service**: Manages the end-to-end search workflow
2. **Query Generation Service**: Transforms natural language into optimized search queries
3. **Contact Extraction Service**: Identifies and validates contact information from web content
4. **AI Integration Service**: Provides unified interface for frontend components

### Q: Who is the target audience for this feature?
A: The feature is designed for:
- **Journalists**: Finding expert sources and story contacts
- **PR Professionals**: Identifying relevant media contacts for campaigns
- **Content Creators**: Discovering experts and influencers for content
- **Researchers**: Finding subject matter experts and industry contacts

### Q: What are the key benefits for users?
A: Key benefits include:
- Time savings through automated contact discovery
- Higher quality results through AI-powered validation
- Better match to user intent through natural language understanding
- Confidence scoring to help prioritize contacts
- Duplicate detection to avoid redundant entries

## Technical Questions

### Q: What AI service providers does the feature use?
A: The system integrates with multiple AI providers:
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Primary model for query enhancement and content analysis
- **OpenRouter**: Backup provider with access to multiple models
- **Anthropic Claude**: Alternative for specific content types

The system automatically selects the appropriate provider based on task type and availability.

### Q: How does the query generation process work?
A: The query generation process involves:
1. Analyzing the user's natural language query
2. Using AI to generate multiple search query variations
3. Applying templates for structured query formats
4. Scoring and deduplicating queries
5. Selecting the optimal set of queries for coverage

### Q: What happens during the contact extraction process?
A: Contact extraction involves:
1. Retrieving full content from promising sources
2. Using AI to identify contact information in the content
3. Validating email addresses and social media profiles
4. Calculating confidence and quality scores
5. Detecting and handling duplicate contacts across sources

### Q: How are confidence scores calculated?
A: Confidence scores are calculated based on:
- Source credibility and authority
- Contact information completeness
- Validation results (email format, social media verification)
- Cross-reference consistency across sources
- AI model confidence in extraction

Scores range from 0.0 (very low confidence) to 1.0 (very high confidence).

### Q: What is the typical search response time?
A: Response times vary based on query complexity and system load:
- **Simple queries**: 10-20 seconds
- **Standard queries**: 20-30 seconds
- **Complex queries**: 30-60 seconds
- **Very complex queries**: May take up to 90 seconds

The system shows real-time progress updates to manage user expectations.

### Q: How does the system handle duplicate contacts?
A: The system uses multiple methods to detect duplicates:
- **Email matching**: Identical email addresses
- **Name similarity**: Similar names with same publication
- **Profile matching**: Similar bio information and beats
- **Social media matching**: Identical or similar social media profiles

When duplicates are detected, the system selects the most complete and reliable entry.

## Troubleshooting Questions

### Q: A user reports getting no results for a valid search query. What should I check first?
A: First check:
1. User account status and feature flags
2. Query complexity and specificity
3. Applied filters that might be too restrictive
4. System status and AI provider availability
