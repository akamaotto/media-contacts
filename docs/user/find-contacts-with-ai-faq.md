# Find Contacts with AI: Frequently Asked Questions

This FAQ addresses common questions about the "Find Contacts with AI" feature to help you get the most out of this powerful tool.

## General Questions

### What is "Find Contacts with AI"?

"Find Contacts with AI" is an advanced search feature that uses artificial intelligence to understand natural language queries and find highly relevant media contacts. Instead of using complex keywords and filters, you can simply describe what you're looking for in plain English.

- **Better Results**: Get contacts based on meaning, not just keywords
- **Ease of Use**: Search using natural language instead of complex syntax
- **Continuous Learning**: The system improves with every search
- **Intelligent Suggestions**: Get recommendations for related contacts and topics

## Getting Started

You can access the feature in three ways:
1. Click "Find Contacts with AI" in the main navigation
2. Use the AI-powered search bar at the top of the contacts list
3. Press `Ctrl+K` (or `Cmd+K` on Mac) anywhere in the application

### Is there an additional cost for this feature?

The feature is available to all users, with usage limits varying by subscription tier:

During the launch period, all users enjoy enhanced search limits for 30 days.

### Do I need to install anything?

No installation is required. "Find Contacts with AI" is fully integrated into the platform and works immediately after activation.

## Using the Feature

### What kind of queries work best?

The most effective queries are:
- **Specific**: Include details about topics, locations, or publication types
- **Natural**: Write as you would speak to a research assistant
- **Context-rich**: Provide relevant background information

**Good examples**:
- "Find technology journalists covering AI startups in Silicon Valley"
- "Show me fashion writers focusing on sustainable brands"
- "I need political reporters for major newspapers who cover healthcare"

**Less effective examples**:
- "journalists"
- "tech"
- "writers new york"

### Can I use filters with AI search?

Yes! After your initial search, you can apply filters to refine results:
- Location (country, city, remote)
- Beat/topic (technology, business, politics, etc.)
- Publication type (newspapers, magazines, online)
- Contact type (journalists, editors, freelancers)

### How does the relevance scoring work?

Each search result includes a relevance score (0-100%) indicating how well the contact matches your query. The score considers:
- Topic alignment
- Geographic relevance
- Publication authority
- Recent activity
- Coverage history

### Can I save my searches and results?

Yes, you can:
- **Save Searches**: Keep successful searches for future use
- **Favorite Contacts**: Click the star icon to save contacts
- **Create Collections**: Organize contacts by project or campaign
- **Export Results**: Download contacts as CSV or PDF

## Technical Questions

### How does the AI understand my queries?

The system uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) to:
- Parse and understand your query structure
- Identify key entities and concepts
- Determine search intent and context
- Match with relevant contacts in the database

### What happens if I make spelling mistakes?

The AI is designed to handle:
- Common spelling errors
- Typos and minor mistakes
- Alternative spellings
- Abbreviations and acronyms

For best results, try to use correct terminology, but don't worry about minor errors.

### How quickly do I get results?

Most searches return results within 3-5 seconds. Complex queries or searches with many filters may take slightly longer. If a search takes more than 30 seconds, it will time out and suggest refining your query.

### Can I use Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)?

The AI is designed to understand natural language rather than formal Boolean operators. Instead of:
- `journalists AND technology AND New York`
- `journalists OR bloggers`
- `journalists NOT sports`

Try natural language equivalents:
- "technology journalists in New York"
- "journalists and bloggers"
- "journalists but not sports writers"

## Privacy and Security

### Is my search history private?

Yes, your search history is completely private and secure. We don't share individual searches or personal data with third parties. Search patterns are only used in aggregate to improve the system.

### How is my data protected?

- All data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- We comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection regulations
- Regular security audits ensure data safety
- You can request data deletion at any time

### Does the AI learn from my searches?

The system improves from aggregate usage patterns, not individual searches. No personal data or specific search content is stored or used for training without your explicit consent.

## Account and Billing

### How are searches counted toward my limit?

Each search query is counted as one search, regardless of the number of results returned. Refining results with filters doesn't count as additional searches.

### What happens when I reach my search limit?

You'll receive a notification when you're approaching your limit. Once reached:
- Free users can upgrade their plan or wait for monthly reset
- Professional users can purchase additional search packs
- Enterprise users have unlimited searches

### Can I get more searches during the launch period?

All users automatically receive enhanced search limits during the 30-day launch period. No action is required to activate this benefit.

## Troubleshooting

### Why am I getting no results?

If your search returns no results:
- Try broader terms (e.g., "technology writers" instead of "AI startup journalists")
- Remove specific constraints
- Check spelling and try variations
- Use different phrasing
- Contact support if issues persist

### Why are my results not relevant?

If results don't match your needs:
- Add more specific keywords
- Include location or publication context

### Why is the search running slowly?

Slow searches can be caused by:
- Complex queries with many constraints
- High system traffic during peak hours
- Network connectivity issues
- Browser performance issues

Try simplifying your query or searching during off-peak hours.

### What should I do if I see an error?

If you encounter an error:
- Refresh the page and try again
- Check your internet connection
- Verify you're logged in properly
- Try the search in an incognito window
- Contact support if the error persists
