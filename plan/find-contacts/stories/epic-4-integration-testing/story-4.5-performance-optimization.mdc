## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines
- Use performance profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
- Implement performance testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Monitor performance metrics in development and production
- Use performance budgets to prevent regressions
- Document performance optimization decisions

### Performance Monitoring Strategy
```javascript
// Example performance monitoring setup
const performanceMonitor = {
  // Database query performance
  trackQuery: (query, duration) => {
    if (duration > 100) {
      console.warn(`Slow query detected: ${duration}ms`, query);
    }
  },

  // API response performance
  trackApiResponse: (endpoint, duration) => {
    if (duration > 200) {
      console.warn(`Slow API response: ${duration}ms for ${endpoint}`);
    }
  },

  // Search performance
  trackSearch: (searchId, duration) => {
    if (duration > 30000) {
      console.warn(`Slow search: ${duration}ms for ${searchId}`);
    }
  }
};
```

### Database Optimization Examples
```sql
-- Add indexes for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_ai_searches_user_created ON ai_searches(user_id, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_media_contacts_country_category ON media_contacts(country_id, category_id);

-- Optimize search queries
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM media_contacts
WHERE country_id = $1 AND category_id = $2
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

### Frontend Optimization Examples
```javascript
// Implement virtual scrolling for large result sets
import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

const Row = ({ index, style }) => (
  <div style={style}>
    <ContactCard contact={contacts[index]} />
  </div>
);

const VirtualizedResults = () => (
  <List
    height={600}
    itemCount={contacts.length}
    itemSize={80}
  >
    {Row}
  </List>
);

// Implement memoization for expensive components
const ContactCard = React.memo(({ contact }) => {
  return (
    <div className="contact-card">
      {/* Contact details */}
    </div>
  );
});
```

### Load Testing Strategy
- **Concurrent Users**: Test with 50+ simultaneous users
- **Search Load**: Test multiple concurrent searches
- **Database Load**: Test database under concurrent queries
- **Memory Stress**: Test for memory leaks under extended use
- **Network Conditions**: Test under various network speeds

### Performance Monitoring Tools
- **Database**: Query performance monitoring tools
- **Backend**: APM solutions (DataDog, New Relic)
- **Frontend**: Web Vitals monitoring
- **Infrastructure**: Server monitoring and alerting
- **User Experience**: Real User Monitoring (RUM)
