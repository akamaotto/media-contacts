## Success Score Calculation

### Scoring Algorithm

The overall success score is calculated using a weighted average of all criteria:

```
Overall Score = Σ (Criteria Score × Weight) / Σ (Weights)
```

**Criteria Score Calculation:**
- **100%:** Target met or exceeded
- **80%:** Within 90% of target
- **60%:** Within 80% of target
- **40%:** Within 70% of target
- **20%:** Within 60% of target
- **0%:** Below 60% of target

### Success Levels

| Score Range | Success Level | Description |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| 90-100% | **Excellent** | All or most targets exceeded |
| 80-89% | **Good** | Most targets met, some exceeded |
| 70-79% | **Satisfactory** | Most targets met, few exceeded |
| 60-69% | **Needs Improvement** | Some targets met, others missed |
| 50-59% | **Concerning** | Many targets missed |
| Below 50% | **Critical** | Most targets missed |

### Category Scores

Success is also evaluated at the category level:

| Category | Weight | Success Threshold |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Technical Performance | 34% | ≥ 80% |
| User Adoption | 30% | ≥ 70% |
