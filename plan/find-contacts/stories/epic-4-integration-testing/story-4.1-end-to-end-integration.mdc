Epic 4: Integration & Testing

## Objective
Integrate all AI search components into a cohesive end-to-end feature with proper data flow, error handling, and state management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete user workflow functions end-to-end without errors
- [ ] Frontend components successfully communicate with backend API
- [ ] AI search services integrate seamlessly with orchestration layer
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages all failure scenarios
- [ ] Data validation prevents invalid states throughout the system
- [ ] User feedback provides clear, actionable information
- [ ] State management maintains consistency across the application
- [ ] Real-time updates function correctly during search execution
- [ ] Import/export workflows work with search results
- [ ] Feature integrates properly with existing contact management system

## Technical Requirements
- Integrate frontend modal components with AI search API endpoints
- Implement state management for search workflow using existing patterns
- Create error boundary components for graceful failure handling
- Implement data validation and sanitization at all integration points
- Add user feedback and notification systems using existing UI components
- Ensure real-time updates work via WebSocket or Server-Sent Events
- Validate import/export functionality with discovered contacts

## Definition of Done
- All acceptance criteria are met and validated
- Code is reviewed and approved
- Integration tests cover all API endpoints and data flows
- Documentation is updated with integration details
- Integration with existing system works seamlessly
- Performance requirements are met during integration

## Objective
Integrate all AI search components into a cohesive end-to-end feature with proper data flow, error handling, and state management. This story connects the frontend components from Epic 3 with the backend services from Epics 1-2 to create a complete, functional user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete user workflow functions end-to-end without errors
- [ ] Frontend components successfully communicate with backend API
- [ ] AI search services integrate seamlessly with orchestration layer
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages all failure scenarios
- [ ] Data validation prevents invalid states throughout the system
- [ ] User feedback provides clear, actionable information
- [ ] State management maintains consistency across the application
- [ ] Real-time updates function correctly during search execution
- [ ] Import/export workflows work with search results
- [ ] Feature integrates properly with existing contact management system

## Technical Requirements

### Core Features
- Connect FindContactsModal to `/api/ai/search` endpoint
- Implement SearchForm integration with query validation
- Connect SearchProgress components to real-time update streams
- Integrate ResultsTable with search results API
- Implement ContactPreview with detailed contact information
- Connect bulk import functionality with existing contact management

### Integration Points
- Frontend â†’ Backend API communication
- Backend â†’ External AI services integration
- Search orchestration â†” Database operations
- Real-time updates via WebSocket/SSE
- State management across components
- Error handling and user feedback systems

### Dependencies
- Epic 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (database schema, API infrastructure)
- Epic 2: AI Search Service (query generation, contact extraction, orchestration)
- Epic 3: Frontend Components (modals, forms, progress tracking, results display)

## Definition of Done
- All acceptance criteria are met and validated
- Code is reviewed and approved
- Integration tests cover all API endpoints and data flows
- Documentation is updated with integration details
- Integration with existing system works seamlessly
- Performance requirements are met during integration

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Test all integration service functions
- Validate error handling in integration layer
- Test data transformation and validation
- Verify state management consistency

### Integration Tests
- Test frontend â†’ backend API communication
- Validate search workflow end-to-end
- Test error scenarios and recovery
- Verify real-time update functionality

### E2E Tests
- Complete user workflow from search to import
- Test all error scenarios and user feedback
- Verify import/export functionality
- Test system integration with existing features

### Performance Tests
- Validate response times for all integrated operations
- Test concurrent user handling
- Verify memory usage during long-running searches
- Test real-time update performance

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines
- Follow existing integration patterns in the codebase
- Use established error handling and logging practices
- Implement proper TypeScript types for all integration points
- Follow existing state management patterns
- Use existing UI components for consistency

### Best Practices
- Implement comprehensive error boundaries
- Use proper loading states and user feedback
- Implement proper data validation at all layers
- Use existing authentication and authorization patterns
- Follow established API response formatting

### Security Considerations
- Ensure all API endpoints require proper authentication
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Implement proper rate limiting on integrated endpoints
- Ensure sensitive data is properly handled
- Follow existing security patterns

### Performance Considerations
- Implement proper caching for integrated operations
- Optimize API response times
- Implement efficient real-time update mechanisms
- Optimize database queries for integration scenarios
- Implement proper resource cleanup
