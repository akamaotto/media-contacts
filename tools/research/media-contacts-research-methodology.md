# Media Contacts Research Methodology

## Overview

This document outlines the methodology used to research and collect media contacts for seeding the platform with high-quality contacts in the tech, startups, economy, finance, and business sectors.

## Research Process

### 1. Identify Target Sectors
We focused on five key sectors:
- Technology
- Startups
- Economy
- Finance
- Business

### 2. Select Target Publications
We identified leading publications in each sector:
- **Technology**: TechCrunch, VentureBeat, Reuters, Bloomberg
- **Startups**: TechCrunch, Inc., Entrepreneur, Bloomberg
- **Finance**: Forbes, The Economist, Reuters, Bloomberg
- **Business/Economy**: Forbes, The Economist, Inc., Entrepreneur

### 3. Identify Key Reporters
For each publication, we identified reporters who specialize in our target sectors by:
- Reviewing publication staff directories
- Examining reporter bylines and focus areas
- Checking social media profiles for beat information
- Reviewing Muck Rack and LinkedIn profiles

### 4. Data Collection
For each reporter, we collected the following information:
- Full name
- Email (when publicly available)
- Professional title
- Associated outlet(s)
- Geographic coverage areas
- Primary beats/coverage areas
- Social media handles (Twitter, LinkedIn)
- Brief professional bio
- Contact preferences/notes

### 5. Data Validation
We validated information by cross-referencing multiple sources:
- Official publication websites
- Social media profiles
- Professional networking sites (LinkedIn)
- Media databases (Muck Rack)

## Data Sources

1. **Official Publication Websites**: Author pages and staff directories
2. **Social Media Platforms**: Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram
3. **Professional Media Databases**: Muck Rack, BuzzSumo
4. **Conference Speaker Directories**: Web Summit, RAISE Summit
5. **Personal Websites/Portfolios**: Where available

## Quality Assurance

To ensure data quality, we:
1. Only included reporters from reputable publications
2. Verified information across multiple sources
3. Focused on reporters with clear specialization in our target sectors
4. Prioritized reporters with active social media presence and recent publications
5. Included contact preferences when available

## Data Structure

The collected data follows the platform's required format:
- Name
- Email
- Title
- Outlet
- Beats (comma-separated)
- Countries (comma-separated)
- Twitter Handle
- Instagram Handle
- LinkedIn URL
- Bio
- Notes
- Author Links (comma-separated)

## Expansion Strategy

To expand the contact database in the future:
1. Monitor publication staff changes and new hires
2. Track reporters who change beats or publications
3. Identify emerging publications in target sectors
4. Regularly update contact information and social media handles
5. Add reporters from regional/local publications for geographic diversity

## Limitations

1. **Email Privacy**: Many reporters do not publicly share their work emails
2. **Information Accuracy**: Online profiles may not always be up-to-date
3. **Contact Preferences**: Not all reporters specify their preferred contact methods
4. **Geographic Coverage**: Some reporters' coverage areas may change over time

## Best Practices for Contact Maintenance

1. Regularly verify that reporters are still at their listed publications
2. Update social media handles when they change
3. Monitor for reporters who change their beats or focus areas
4. Remove contacts who are no longer active in journalism
5. Add new reporters who join target publications
