# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Media Contacts page currently has several usability and functionality issues that need to be addressed to provide a better user experience. The page lacks proper pagination controls, has incomplete filtering options, displays truncated badge text, and has navigation issues. This feature aims to fix these problems and enhance the overall functionality of the Media Contacts management interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Implement Pagination Controls

**User Story:** As a user managing media contacts, I want to navigate through pages of contacts efficiently, so that I can browse large datasets without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the media contacts table loads THEN the system SHALL display pagination controls at the bottom of the table
2. WHEN there are more contacts than the page size THEN the system SHALL show page navigation buttons (first, previous, next, last)
3. WHEN a user clicks on a page navigation button THEN the system SHALL load the appropriate page of contacts
4. WHEN the user changes the page size THEN the system SHALL update the display and reset to page 1
5. WHEN pagination controls are displayed THEN the system SHALL show current page information (e.g., "Page 1 of 5" or "Showing 1-10 of 50 contacts")

### Requirement 2: Add Missing Filter Options

**User Story:** As a user searching for specific media contacts, I want to filter by outlets, regions, and languages, so that I can find contacts more precisely based on their coverage areas and communication preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the filters section loads THEN the system SHALL display outlet, region, and language filter dropdowns
2. WHEN a user selects outlets from the filter THEN the system SHALL show only contacts associated with those outlets
3. WHEN a user selects regions from the filter THEN the system SHALL show only contacts from countries in those regions
4. WHEN a user selects languages from the filter THEN the system SHALL show only contacts who work in those languages
5. WHEN multiple filters are applied THEN the system SHALL combine them using AND logic
6. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL display active filter badges with clear options
7. WHEN a user clears a filter THEN the system SHALL update the results immediately

### Requirement 3: Fix Badge Text Truncation

**User Story:** As a user viewing media contacts, I want to see complete information in the outlets, countries, and beats columns, so that I can understand each contact's full scope without having to open detail views.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN badges are displayed in table columns THEN the system SHALL show full text without truncation when space allows
2. WHEN there are multiple items in a column THEN the system SHALL display the first few items with a "+X more" indicator
3. WHEN badges are too long for the column width THEN the system SHALL use tooltips to show full text on hover
4. WHEN the table is resized THEN the system SHALL adjust badge display responsively
5. WHEN there are no items for a column THEN the system SHALL display a clear empty state indicator

### Requirement 4: Enable Row Click Navigation

**User Story:** As a user browsing media contacts, I want to click on any table row to view detailed contact information, so that I can quickly access full contact details without using the actions menu.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on any part of a contact row THEN the system SHALL open the contact detail view sheet
2. WHEN a user clicks on action buttons within a row THEN the system SHALL prevent the row click event from triggering
3. WHEN the detail view opens THEN the system SHALL display all contact information including bio, social links, and author links
4. WHEN the detail view is open THEN the system SHALL provide options to edit or delete the contact
5. WHEN the user closes the detail view THEN the system SHALL return to the table view without losing current filters or page position

### Requirement 5: Remove Duplicate Headers

**User Story:** As a user navigating the media contacts page, I want to see a clean, single page header, so that the interface is not cluttered with redundant information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the media contacts page loads THEN the system SHALL display only one page header
2. WHEN the page header is displayed THEN the system SHALL include the page title, description, and primary actions
3. WHEN the header shows contact count THEN the system SHALL update the count based on current filters
4. WHEN the page layout is rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent spacing and visual hierarchy
5. WHEN responsive breakpoints are reached THEN the system SHALL adapt the header layout appropriately

### Requirement 6: Enhance Email Verification Display

**User Story:** As a user reviewing media contacts, I want to clearly see which contacts have verified email addresses, so that I can prioritize outreach to contacts with confirmed contact information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the contacts table displays THEN the system SHALL show email verification status with clear visual indicators
2. WHEN an email is verified THEN the system SHALL display a green checkmark or "Verified" badge
3. WHEN an email is unverified THEN the system SHALL display an amber warning icon or "Unverified" badge
4. WHEN filtering by email verification status THEN the system SHALL accurately filter contacts based on their verification status
5. WHEN the email verification filter is applied THEN the system SHALL show the active filter in the filter badges section

### Requirement 7: Improve Table Performance and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user working with large datasets of media contacts, I want the table to load quickly and respond smoothly to interactions, so that I can work efficiently without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the table loads data THEN the system SHALL display loading states for better user feedback
2. WHEN filters are changed THEN the system SHALL debounce API calls to prevent excessive requests
3. WHEN the table is loading THEN the system SHALL show skeleton loaders that match the table structure
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with retry options
5. WHEN data is successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL show performance metrics (optional, for debugging)
