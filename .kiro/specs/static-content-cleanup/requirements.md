# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The codebase currently contains extensive static content for countries, languages, and regions that was originally used for seeding the database. This static data is now redundant since all content should be sourced from the database. The goal is to clean up this static content while preserving essential types, interfaces, and utility functions that are still needed by the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove static data arrays from the codebase, so that the application relies solely on database content and reduces code bloat.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN static data files are examined THEN all hardcoded arrays of countries, languages, and regions SHALL be removed
2. WHEN static data is removed THEN essential TypeScript interfaces and types SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN static data is removed THEN utility functions that are still used by the application SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN static data files are cleaned THEN any duplicate or redundant files SHALL be consolidated or removed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure no code references static data arrays, so that the application functions correctly without static content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is scanned THEN all imports of static data arrays SHALL be identified and updated
2. WHEN static data imports are found THEN they SHALL be replaced with database queries or removed if no longer needed
3. WHEN seed files reference static data THEN they SHALL be updated to use alternative data sources or be marked for manual data entry
4. WHEN components reference static data THEN they SHALL be updated to use database-sourced data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain code functionality after cleanup, so that existing features continue to work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN static data is removed THEN all TypeScript compilation errors SHALL be resolved
2. WHEN imports are updated THEN all runtime errors related to missing data SHALL be prevented
3. WHEN utility functions are preserved THEN they SHALL continue to work with database-sourced data
4. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN existing tests SHALL pass or be updated accordingly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation between types/utilities and static content, so that future maintenance is easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files contain both types and static data THEN they SHALL be refactored to separate concerns
2. WHEN types are extracted THEN they SHALL be placed in appropriate type definition files
3. WHEN utility functions are preserved THEN they SHALL be moved to dedicated utility files
4. WHEN file structure is reorganized THEN import paths SHALL be updated consistently across the codebase
