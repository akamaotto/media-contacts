## Getting Started

### What is Find Contacts with AI?

Find Contacts with AI is an intelligent search feature that helps you discover media contacts using natural language queries. Instead of complex keyword searches, you can simply describe what you're looking for in plain English, and our AI will find the most relevant contacts for you.

### How to Access the Feature

1. Log in to your Media Contacts account
2. Navigate to the "Contacts" section
3. Click on "Find Contacts with AI"
4. If you don't see this option, ensure your subscription plan includes AI Search

### System Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
- Stable internet connection
- JavaScript enabled
- Cookies and local storage allowed

## Writing Effective Search Queries

### Natural Language vs. Keywords

Our AI understands natural language, so you can describe exactly what you need:

**Good Examples:**
- "Technology journalists covering artificial intelligence startups in California"
- "Fashion writers focusing on sustainable brands in Europe"
- "Political reporters for major newspapers who cover healthcare policy"

**Less Effective Examples:**
- "tech AI journalists California"
- "fashion sustainable Europe"
- "political healthcare newspapers"

### Be Specific but Flexible

Include relevant details but avoid being overly restrictive:

**Effective Query:**
"Technology journalists who write about artificial intelligence and machine learning for major publications in the United States"

**Too Restrictive:**
"Technology journalists who write specifically about neural networks in deep learning for publications with over 1 million monthly readers in California, New York, or Massachusetts"

### Include Context and Intent

Help the AI understand why you need these contacts:

**With Context:**
"I'm looking for technology journalists to review our new AI productivity tool for a product launch next month"

**Without Context:**
"Technology journalists"

### Use Industry Terminology

Incorporate standard industry terms that professionals would use:

**Good Examples:**
- "FinTech reporters covering blockchain and cryptocurrency"
- "Healthcare writers specializing in telemedicine and digital health"
- "Business journalists focusing on venture capital and startup funding"

- Try again in a few minutes

### Results Don't Match Your Intent

**Possible Causes:**
- Query is ambiguous or unclear
- AI misunderstands your intent

**Solutions:**
