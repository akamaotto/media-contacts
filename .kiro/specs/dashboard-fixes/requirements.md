# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues in the dashboard interface and functionality, focusing on improving chart visualization, fixing the activity feed system, and resolving CRUD operations for beats management. The improvements will enhance user experience by providing cleaner visualizations, functional activity tracking, and reliable data management operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want the Contacts by Category chart to display clearly without text overlap and unnecessary whitespace, so that I can easily interpret the data through hover interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Contacts by Category chart THEN the system SHALL hide category labels from the chart display
2. WHEN hovering over a chart segment THEN the system SHALL display the category name and count in a tooltip
3. WHEN the chart renders THEN the system SHALL maximize the chart size within its container by removing unnecessary whitespace
4. WHEN the chart displays THEN the system SHALL ensure all visual elements are properly sized and positioned without overlap

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want the Contacts by Country chart to utilize its full container space without negative space, so that I can view country data in an optimized layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Contacts by Country chart THEN the system SHALL eliminate unnecessary negative space around the chart
2. WHEN the chart renders THEN the system SHALL properly size the chart to fit its allocated container space
3. WHEN displaying country data THEN the system SHALL ensure optimal spacing between chart elements
4. WHEN the chart loads THEN the system SHALL maintain proper aspect ratio while maximizing space utilization

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user performing CRUD operations, I want to see real-time activity updates in the activity feed, so that I can track changes made across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates, updates, or deletes any entity THEN the system SHALL record the activity in the activity feed
2. WHEN an activity is recorded THEN the system SHALL display the user name, action performed, entity affected, and timestamp
3. WHEN viewing the activity feed THEN the system SHALL show activities in chronological order with most recent first
4. WHEN multiple activities occur THEN the system SHALL update the feed in real-time without requiring page refresh
5. WHEN an activity is logged THEN the system SHALL include sufficient detail for users to understand what changed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user managing beats, I want to successfully create and update beat records, so that I can maintain accurate beat information in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting a new beat form THEN the system SHALL successfully create the beat record in the database
2. WHEN updating an existing beat THEN the system SHALL save changes without throwing errors
3. WHEN a beat operation fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message indicating the specific issue
4. WHEN beat operations succeed THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation feedback to the user
5. WHEN beat forms are submitted THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields before processing
6. WHEN beat CRUD operations complete THEN the system SHALL update the beats list to reflect changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user viewing the media contacts table, I want all components to render correctly without TypeScript errors or broken interfaces, so that I can effectively manage my media contacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the media contacts page THEN the system SHALL display the AppBrandHeader component with proper title, subtitle, and action buttons
2. WHEN interacting with contact details THEN the system SHALL open the ViewMediaContactSheet with all required props and correct type interfaces
3. WHEN the table loads THEN the system SHALL display contact data with consistent type definitions across all components
4. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN the system SHALL have no type errors or interface mismatches in media contacts components
5. WHEN viewing contact badges THEN the system SHALL display outlets, beats, and countries with proper styling and truncation
6. WHEN components render THEN the system SHALL use consistent data interfaces without type conversion errors
