## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines
- Use React Virtual or TanStack Table for virtualization
- Implement proper TypeScript types for all data structures
- Follow React best practices for component composition
- Use existing design system components and patterns
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states

### Best Practices
- Implement proper loading states for all async operations
- Use semantic HTML and proper ARIA attributes
- Follow consistent naming conventions and code structure
- Implement proper cleanup for event listeners and subscriptions
- Use CSS-in-JS or Tailwind for consistent styling

### Security Considerations
- Sanitize all displayed user-generated content
- Implement proper XSS prevention
- Secure API communication with authentication
- Validate all user inputs for bulk operations
- Audit logging for import/export activities

### Performance Considerations
- Implement efficient algorithms for sorting and filtering
- Use memoization for expensive computations
- Optimize bundle size through code splitting
- Implement proper image lazy loading
- Use Web Workers for heavy computations
