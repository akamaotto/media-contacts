# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving the Media Contacts Management System, a Next.js application for managing large datasets of journalists, bloggers, and media contacts. The current system handles basic CRUD operations, search, and filtering, but has several architectural gaps and performance limitations that need to be addressed to support enterprise-scale usage and improve maintainability.

The improvement initiative focuses on enhancing system architecture, performance optimization, security hardening, user experience improvements, and establishing robust development practices to transform this from a functional prototype into a production-ready enterprise application.

## Requirements

**User Story:** As a security-conscious organization, I want robust authentication, authorization, and data protection measures, so that sensitive media contact information remains secure and access is properly controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL implement secure session management with proper token expiration
2. WHEN accessing admin functions THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access control with proper authorization checks
3. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL implement input sanitization and SQL injection prevention
4. WHEN logging user activities THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails without exposing sensitive information
5. WHEN implementing API endpoints THEN they SHALL include rate limiting and request validation

### Requirement 5: User Experience and Interface Improvements

**User Story:** As a daily user of the media contacts system, I want an intuitive, responsive interface with helpful feedback and efficient workflows, so that I can manage contacts productively without frustration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing long-running operations THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress indicators and status updates
2. WHEN encountering errors THEN the system SHALL display clear, actionable error messages with suggested solutions
3. WHEN using search and filter functions THEN the system SHALL provide autocomplete suggestions and filter previews
4. WHEN managing large lists THEN the system SHALL implement virtual scrolling and efficient pagination
5. WHEN using the mobile interface THEN all functionality SHALL be accessible and usable on mobile devices

### Requirement 6: Data Import/Export Enhancement

**User Story:** As a data manager, I want robust CSV import/export capabilities with validation and error handling, so that I can efficiently manage bulk data operations without data corruption or system failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing CSV files THEN the system SHALL validate data format and provide detailed error reports for invalid records
2. WHEN processing large imports THEN the system SHALL handle the operation in chunks to prevent memory issues
3. WHEN duplicate records are detected THEN the system SHALL provide options for merge strategies or conflict resolution
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats and allow custom field selection
5. WHEN import/export operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities and detailed error logs

### Requirement 7: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want comprehensive testing coverage and quality assurance processes, so that we can confidently deploy changes without introducing regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made THEN automated tests SHALL cover at least 80% of critical functionality
2. WHEN testing with large datasets THEN performance tests SHALL validate response times under realistic load conditions
3. WHEN deploying to production THEN end-to-end tests SHALL verify all critical user workflows
4. WHEN API changes are made THEN integration tests SHALL validate backward compatibility
5. WHEN security features are implemented THEN security tests SHALL validate protection against common vulnerabilities

### Requirement 8: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities, so that I can proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system errors occur THEN they SHALL be automatically logged with sufficient context for debugging
