## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Search Returns No Results

#### Symptoms
- User receives "No results found" message
- Search completes but returns empty contact list
- Results page shows "No contacts match your criteria"

#### Common Causes
- Query is too specific or narrow
- Search terms are misspelled or incorrect
- Geographic or topic filters are too restrictive
- Data sources don't cover the requested niche

#### Troubleshooting Steps

**Step 1: Analyze the Query**
```bash
Ask the user:
- What exact query did you enter?
- What filters did you apply?
- Have you tried variations of this query?

Example conversation:
"I notice your query 'quantum computing journalists in Antarctica' is quite specific. 
Let's try broadening it to 'quantum computing journalists' and see if we get results."
```

**Step 2: Check Filters**
```bash
Review applied filters:
- Geographic locations
- Industry categories
- Publication types
- Time ranges

Example solution:
"I see you've filtered to only include contacts from publications with fewer than 100 readers. 
This is significantly limiting our results. Let's try removing that filter."
```

**Step 3: Suggest Alternative Approaches**
```bash
Provide alternative query strategies:
- Use broader search terms
- Remove restrictive filters
- Try different keyword combinations
- Search for related topics

Example suggestions:
"Instead of 'blockchain journalists specializing in DeFi protocols', try:
- 'blockchain journalists'
- 'cryptocurrency writers'
- 'financial technology reporters'"
```

#### Solution Templates

**Template 1: Query Too Specific**
```
I understand you're looking for very specific contacts. The query you're using might be too narrow for our current data sources. Let's try these alternatives:

1. Broader version: [SIMPLER_QUERY]
2. Different keywords: [ALTERNATIVE_KEYWORDS]
3. Remove specific filters: [FILTERS_TO_REMOVE]

Would you like me to help you refine this search?
```

**Template 2: Data Coverage Limitation**
```
It appears this is a very specialized topic with limited coverage in our current data sources. Here are some suggestions:

1. Try related broader topics that might include your contacts
2. Consider searching without geographic restrictions
3. Look for contacts in adjacent industries

I've also documented this gap in our data coverage for our team to review.
```

### Issue 2: Search is Slow or Times Out

#### Symptoms
- Search takes longer than 30-45 seconds
- Page shows "Loading" indefinitely
- Search fails with timeout error
- Progress bar gets stuck at a certain percentage

#### Common Causes
- Complex or lengthy search query
- High system load during peak hours
- AI service provider latency
- Network connectivity issues
- Too many sources to process

#### Troubleshooting Steps

**Step 1: Check System Performance**
```bash
Verify system status:
- Check system status dashboard
- Look for high load indicators
- Verify AI provider response times
- Check for ongoing maintenance

Internal tool: /support/system-status
```

**Step 2: Analyze Query Complexity**
```bash
Evaluate query characteristics:
- Length and complexity of natural language query
- Number of filters applied
- Specificity of search terms
- Geographic scope of search

Example analysis:
"Your query is quite complex with multiple specific criteria. 
This requires processing many sources, which takes longer."
```

**Step 3: Optimize Search Strategy**
```bash
Suggest performance improvements:
- Simplify query language
- Reduce number of filters
- Search during off-peak hours
- Break complex searches into multiple simpler ones

Example suggestions:
"Try splitting your search into two parts:
1. First search for 'technology journalists'
2. Then filter those results for AI specialists"
```

#### Solution Templates

**Template 1: Temporary Slow Performance**
```
I apologize for the slow performance. We're experiencing higher than normal load on our AI services, which is affecting response times. Here are some options:

1. Try again in a few minutes when load decreases
2. Use a simpler query for faster results
3. I can monitor your search and notify you when it completes

Would you like me to help optimize your query for better performance?
```

**Template 2: Complex Query Timeout**
```
Your search query is quite complex and is timing out due to the extensive processing required. Let's try this approach:

1. Simplified query: [SIMPLER_VERSION]
2. Fewer filters: [REDUCED_FILTERS]
3. Multiple smaller searches: [BREAKDOWN_SUGGESTION]

This should give you results more quickly while still covering your needs.
```

### Issue 3: Poor Quality or Irrelevant Results

#### Symptoms
- Results don't match user's intent
- Contacts have outdated information
- Low confidence scores on most results
- Irrelevant publications or beats

#### Common Causes
- Ambiguous or unclear query language
- AI misunderstanding of intent
- Outdated data in sources
- Overly broad search terms

#### Troubleshooting Steps

**Step 1: Clarify User Intent**
```bash
Ask clarifying questions:
- What specific type of contacts are you looking for?
- What industry or topic do they cover?
- What geographic region should they be in?
- What publications do you want to target?

Example conversation:
"I want to make sure I understand exactly what you need. 
Are you looking for journalists who write about AI, or PR professionals who work at AI companies?"
```

**Step 2: Refine Search Query**
```bash
Help improve query construction:
- Add specific industry terminology
- Include publication types or beats
- Specify geographic regions
- Exclude irrelevant topics

Example refinement:
"Instead of 'AI people', let's try 'technology journalists covering artificial intelligence at major publications in North America'"
```

**Step 3: Adjust Search Parameters**
```bash
Modify search settings:
- Increase confidence threshold
- Add specific filters
- Exclude certain sources
- Adjust result quantity

Example adjustment:
"Let's increase the confidence threshold to only show high-quality contacts, and add a filter for 'technology' publications."
```

#### Solution Templates

**Template 1: Query Refinement**
```
I see the results aren't quite matching what you're looking for. Let's refine your search to be more specific:

Instead of: [CURRENT_QUERY]
Try: [IMPROVED_QUERY]

This should help the AI better understand what you need and provide more relevant results.
```

**Template 2: Data Quality Issue**
```
I notice some of these contacts have outdated information. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Here's what I recommend:

1. Use the confidence scores to identify the most reliable contacts
2. Verify critical information before outreach
3. I'll report these quality issues to our data team for correction

Would you like me to help you identify the highest-quality contacts from these results?
```

### Issue 4: Import or Export Failures

#### Symptoms
- Selected contacts won't import to contact lists
- Export function returns error
- Duplicate warnings prevent import
- Partial import success with some failures

#### Common Causes
- Contact validation failures
- Duplicate detection conflicts
- Insufficient permissions
- Format compatibility issues

#### Troubleshooting Steps

**Step 1: Check Contact Validation**
```bash
Verify contact data integrity:
- Email format validation
- Required field completeness
- Data type compatibility
- Character encoding issues

Example check:
"Some contacts are failing validation due to incomplete email addresses. 
Let's identify which ones need correction before importing."
```

**Step 2: Resolve Duplicate Issues**
```bash
Handle duplicate detection:
- Review duplicate detection rules
- Check for existing contacts
- Determine merge vs. create strategy
- Confirm user preferences

Example resolution:
"These contacts appear to already exist in your database. 
Would you like to update the existing contacts or create new entries?"
```

**Step 3: Verify Permissions**
```bash
Check user access rights:
- Contact list creation permissions
- Export functionality access
- Data modification rights
- Account type limitations

Example verification:
"I see you're on a Free plan which has limited export functionality. 
Consider upgrading to Professional for full export capabilities."
```

#### Solution Templates

**Template 1: Validation Failure**
```
Some contacts couldn't be imported due to validation issues. Here's what I found:

- [NUMBER] contacts have incomplete email addresses
- [NUMBER] contacts are missing required fields
- [NUMBER] contacts have formatting issues

You can either:
1. Fix the validation issues and try again
2. Import only the valid contacts ([NUMBER] total)
3. Export the invalid contacts to fix externally

Which option would you prefer?
```

**Template 2: Duplicate Handling**
```
The system detected [NUMBER] potential duplicates in your import. Here are your options:

1. Skip duplicates and import only new contacts
2. Update existing contacts with new information
3. Create separate entries for all contacts
4. Review duplicates individually before deciding

What would you like to do with these duplicates?
```
