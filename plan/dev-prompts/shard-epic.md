# Shard Epic into Development Stories

## Purpose
This prompt breaks down a feature epic into individual development stories, creating detailed story files that can be independently developed and tested.

## Usage
Run this prompt when you have an epic number and name from the implementation plan and need to create detailed development stories.

## Input Parameters
- **epic_number**: The epic number (e.g., "1", "2", "3")
- **epic_name**: The epic name (e.g., "Foundation & Infrastructure", "AI Search Service")
- **feature_path**: Path to the feature planning directory (e.g., "plan/find-contacts")
- **implementation_tasks_file**: Path to the implementation tasks document (optional, defaults to "implementation-tasks.mdc")
- **github_repo**: GitHub repository in format "owner/repo" (e.g., "username/media-contacts")
- **create_github_issues**: Whether to create GitHub issues automatically (true/false)
- **github_labels**: Labels to apply to GitHub issues (comma-separated)

## Output Structure
For each story in the epic, create:
```
{feature_path}/stories/epic-{number}-{name}/story-{number}-{name}.mdc
```

**Important**: Stories must be stored in `plan/{feature-name}/stories/{epic-name}/` directory structure to maintain consistency with the epic planning organization.

## What Each Story Should Contain

### Story Header
```markdown
# Story {number}: {Story Name}
**Epic**: Epic {epic_number}: {epic_name}
**Estimated Time**: {X days}
**Priority**: {Critical|High|Medium|Low}

```

### GitHub CLI Commands for Story Management

#### Bulk Issue Creation
```bash
# Create issues for all stories in an epic
for story_file in plan/{feature}/stories/epic-{number}-{name}/story-*.mdc; do
  story_title=$(grep "^# Story" "$story_file" | sed 's/^# Story //')
  story_body=$(sed -n '/^## Objective$/,/^## /p' "$story_file" | head -n -1)

  gh issue create \
    --title "$story_title" \
    --body "$story_body" \
    --label "epic-{epic_number}" \
    --label "story" \
    --label "enhancement"
done
```

#### Issue Management Commands
```bash
# List all issues for an epic
gh issue list --label "epic-{epic_number}" --state all

# Update issue status
gh issue edit {issue_number} --add-label "in-progress"

# Close completed issue
gh issue close {issue_number} --comment "Story completed and merged"

# Link issue to pull request
gh pr create --body "Closes #{issue_number}"
```

#### Project Board Integration
```bash
# Add issue to project board
gh project item-add {project_number} --issue {issue_number}

# Move issue between columns
gh project item-edit {item_id} --field "Status" --value "In Progress"
```

### Story Format for GitHub CLI Compatibility

When generating stories, include these GitHub CLI-friendly sections:

#### 1. Issue Title Format
```markdown
# Story {epic_number}.{story_number}: {Story Name}
```
This maps directly to GitHub issue titles.

#### 2. Issue Body Structure
```markdown
## Epic
Epic {epic_number}: {epic_name}

## Objective
{Concise objective statement}

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] {Measurable criterion 1}
- [ ] {Measurable criterion 2}
- [ ] {Measurable criterion 3}

## Technical Requirements
{Bulleted list of technical requirements}

## Definition of Done

#### 3. Label Strategy
Standardize labels for better organization:
- `epic-{number}`: Groups stories by epic
- `story`: Identifies story issues
- `priority-critical|priority-high|priority-medium|priority-low`: Priority levels
- `{feature-name}`: Groups by feature
- `frontend|backend|database|testing`: Component type
- `ready-for-dev|in-progress|in-review|done`: Status tracking

#### 4. Assignee Mapping
Map story assignees to GitHub usernames:
```markdown
**Assignee**: {developer_name} (@{github_username})
```

### Story Content
1. **Objective**: Clear statement of what needs to be accomplished
2. **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, measurable criteria for completion
3. **Technical Requirements**: Detailed technical specifications
4. **Dependencies**: What needs to be completed first
5. **Definition of Done**: When the story is considered complete
6. **Testing Requirements**: What tests need to be written
7. **Implementation Notes**: Technical guidance and best practices

## Instructions for the AI

When you receive an epic breakdown request:

1. **Use Correct Directory Structure**: Always create stories in `plan/{feature-name}/stories/{epic-name}/` directory
2. **Read the Implementation Tasks Document**: Locate the epic in the specified implementation tasks file
3. **Identify All Stories**: Extract each task/subtask within the epic
4. **Create Story Directory**: `{feature_path}/stories/epic-{number}-{name}/`
5. **Generate Story Files**: Create one `.mdc` file per story with comprehensive details
6. **Cross-Reference**: Link to relevant technical specs, API contracts, and component specs
7. **Include Context**: Reference the broader feature documentation where relevant
8. **GitHub CLI Optimization**: Format stories for easy GitHub issue creation
9. **Generate CLI Commands**: Provide `gh` commands for issue creation and management
10. **Label Strategy**: Apply consistent labeling for GitHub organization

### GitHub CLI Integration Steps

If `create_github_issues` is true:

1. **Validate GitHub Repository**: Confirm the `github_repo` parameter is valid
2. **Check GitHub CLI Installation**: Verify `gh` command is available
3. **Generate Issue Creation Scripts**: Create bash scripts for bulk issue creation
4. **Apply Label Strategy**: Use consistent labeling based on epic, priority, and component type
5. **Map Assignees**: Convert developer names to GitHub usernames
6. **Create GitHub Issues**: Execute `gh issue create` commands for each story
7. **Update Story Files**: Add issue numbers and labels back to story files
8. **Generate Management Scripts**: Provide scripts for issue status updates

- Test GitHub CLI commands for syntax and validity
- Ensure assignee GitHub usernames are valid
- Apply consistent labeling strategy across all stories
- Generate automation scripts that are robust and error-handling
- Include relative paths to story files in GitHub issues
- Update story files with created issue numbers
- Consider GitHub API rate limits for bulk operations
- Test automation scripts before providing them to users
- Provide clear usage instructions for generated scripts

## Customization Guidelines

### For Different Feature Types
- **Backend-heavy features**: Focus on API, database, and service stories
- **Frontend-heavy features**: Focus on UI components, user flows, and interactions
- **Data-intensive features**: Include data migration, processing, and validation stories
- **Integration features**: Focus on external service integration and data synchronization

### For Different Team Sizes
- **Small teams**: Create larger, more comprehensive stories
- **Large teams**: Break into smaller, more focused stories for parallel work
- **Distributed teams**: Include more detailed documentation and coordination requirements

### For Different Complexity Levels
- **Simple features**: Fewer stories with broader scope
- **Complex features**: More granular stories with specific focus areas
- **High-risk features**: Include additional validation and testing stories
