## Internal FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What exactly is Find Contacts with AI?**
A: Find Contacts with AI is an advanced search feature that uses artificial intelligence to understand natural language queries and find relevant media contacts. It goes beyond simple keyword matching to understand user intent and provide more accurate results.

**Q: How does the AI component work?**
A: The system uses multiple AI models to process user queries, generate search terms, extract contact information from web content, and score the quality and relevance of contacts. It combines multiple AI service providers for optimal performance.

**Q: What are the typical search response times?**
A: Most searches complete within 15-30 seconds, but complex queries or high system load can extend this to 45-60 seconds. Simple queries might complete in as little as 10 seconds.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What AI service providers does the feature use?**
A: The system integrates with OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Anthropic for various aspects of query processing and contact extraction. The specific provider used depends on the task and current system configuration.

**Q: How is contact information validated?**
A: The system performs multiple validation steps including email format checking, domain verification, social media profile validation, and confidence scoring based on source credibility.

**Q: What happens when a search fails?**
A: Failed searches are automatically retried with different parameters. If all attempts fail, the system logs the error and provides the user with specific error information and suggestions for improvement.

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: A user reports getting no results for a valid search query. What should I check first?**
A: First verify the user's account status and feature flags. Then check if the query is too specific or complex. Next, verify system status and AI service availability. Finally, try reproducing the issue with a test account.

**Q: What causes slow search performance?**
A: Common causes include complex queries, high system load, AI service provider latency, network congestion, or cache misses. Check system performance metrics and user's network connection.

**Q: How do I handle a user who is frustrated with search results quality?**
A: First acknowledge their frustration and validate their concerns. Then help them refine their search query with more specific terms and appropriate filters. Document examples of poor results for the engineering team to analyze.

### Billing Questions

**Q: How is the feature billed?**
A: Find Contacts with AI uses a credit-based system where each search consumes one credit. Credit allocation varies by subscription plan: Free (10/month), Professional (100/month), Enterprise (unlimited).

**Q: What happens if a user exceeds their credit limit?**
A: Users receive notifications at 80% and 100% of their limit. Once exceeded, they cannot perform additional searches until the next billing cycle or unless they upgrade their plan.

**Q: Are credits refunded for failed searches?**
A: Credits are not automatically refunded for failed searches, but support agents can issue manual refunds for technical issues beyond the user's control.

### Security Questions

**Q: How is user data protected?**
A: All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. User queries and results are not shared with third parties beyond what's necessary for AI processing. Contact information is stored securely with access controls.

**Q: Can users export their search history?**
A: Users can view their search history within the platform and export individual search results. Full search history export is available upon request through the privacy portal.
