- E2E tests cover all critical user workflows
- Cross-browser and cross-device compatibility verified
- Tests are stable and run reliably in CI/CD pipeline
- Performance benchmarks are met in E2E scenarios
- Accessibility compliance is validated through testing

## Testing Requirements

### User Workflow Tests
- **Complete Search Journey**: From modal open to contact import
- **Advanced Search**: Using all search options and filters
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates during search execution
- **Results Management**: Sorting, filtering, and selecting contacts
- **Import Workflow**: Bulk import with progress tracking
- **Error Recovery**: Handling and recovering from errors

### Cross-Browser Tests
- **Chrome**: Latest stable version testing
- **Firefox**: Latest stable version testing
- **Safari**: Latest stable version testing (macOS/iOS)
- **Edge**: Latest stable version testing (Windows)
- **Browser Features**: Testing modern browser APIs and features

### Responsive Design Tests
- **Mobile**: iPhone SE, iPhone 12, iPhone 14 Pro Max viewports
- **Tablet**: iPad, iPad Air, iPad Pro viewports
- **Desktop**: Various desktop resolutions (1366x768, 1920x1080, 2560x1440)
- **Touch Interactions**: Tap, swipe, pinch, and zoom gestures
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order, shortcuts, and focus management

### Accessibility Tests

- **Memory Usage**: Browser memory consumption during extended use
- **Network Conditions**: Testing on 3G, 4G, and WiFi connections

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines
- Use realistic user data and scenarios in tests
- Implement proper test isolation to prevent interference
- Use page object model for maintainable test code
- Implement proper wait strategies for dynamic content
- Create reusable test components and utilities

### Test Structure Examples
```javascript
describe('AI Search User Workflows', () => {
  describe('Complete Search Journey', () => {
    it('should allow user to search for contacts and import results', async () => {
      // Arrange
      await page.goto('/dashboard/contacts');
      await page.click('[data-testid="find-contacts-button"]');

      // Act - Search
      await page.fill('[data-testid="country-select"]', 'United States');
      await page.fill('[data-testid="category-select"]', 'Technology');
      await page.click('[data-testid="search-button"]');

      // Assert - Search Progress
      await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="search-progress"]')).toBeVisible();
      await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="progress-bar"]')).toHaveAttribute('aria-valuenow', '100');

      // Act - Results
      await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="search-results"]')).toBeVisible();
      await page.click('[data-testid="contact-checkbox"]:first-child');
      await page.click('[data-testid="import-selected-button"]');

      // Assert - Import Success
      await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="import-success"]')).toBeVisible();
    });
  });
});
```

### Test Data Management
- **User Accounts**: Different user roles and permission levels
- **Search Scenarios**: Various search criteria and expected results
- **Contact Data**: Realistic contact information for testing
- **Error Scenarios**: Various error conditions and user responses
- **Performance Data**: Metrics for performance benchmarking

### Visual Testing Strategy
- **Component Screenshots**: Visual regression for key components
- **Workflow Screenshots**: Visual validation of complete workflows
- **Responsive Screenshots**: Visual testing across device sizes
- **Cross-Browser Screenshots**: Visual consistency across browsers
- **Dynamic Content**: Testing visual changes during interactions
