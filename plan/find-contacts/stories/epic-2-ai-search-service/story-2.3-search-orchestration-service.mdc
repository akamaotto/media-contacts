# Story 2.3: Search Orchestration Service
**Epic**: Epic 2: AI Search Service
**Estimated Time**: 3 days
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Pending
**Assignee**: Backend Developer

## Objective
Implement the main search orchestration service that coordinates all AI search components, manages the search lifecycle, and provides real-time progress tracking. The service should handle concurrent searches, manage job queues, and ensure reliable completion of all search operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Search orchestration handles 50+ concurrent searches efficiently
- [ ] Progress tracking provides accurate, real-time updates (<2 second delay)
- [ ] Search cancellation works within 5 seconds of request
- [ ] Result aggregation combines data from multiple sources effectively
- [ ] Caching improves repeat search performance by >60%
- [ ] Retry mechanisms handle temporary failures gracefully
- [ ] Timeout handling prevents infinite searches
- [ ] Performance monitoring tracks all key search metrics
- [ ] Error handling manages all failure scenarios appropriately
- [ ] Search completion time is <30 seconds (95th percentile)

## Technical Requirements

### Core Features
- **Search State Management**: Tracks search lifecycle from initiation to completion
- **Job Queue System**: Manages search processing with priority and concurrency control
- **Progress Tracking**: Provides real-time updates on search progress
- **Result Aggregation**: Combines and deduplicates results from multiple sources
- **Search Cancellation**: Allows users to cancel in-progress searches
- **Timeout Management**: Prevents searches from running indefinitely
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Implements intelligent retry logic for failed operations
- **Search Caching**: Caches search results for improved performance
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks and reports search metrics

### Integration Points
- Query generation service for creating search queries
- Contact extraction pipeline for processing results
- External search APIs (Exa, Firecrawl) for web searches
- Database for search state and result storage
- Progress tracking system for real-time updates
- Monitoring and alerting systems

### Dependencies
- Story 2.1: Query Generation Service
- Story 2.2: Contact Extraction Pipeline
- Epic 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (Database schema, API infrastructure)

## Definition of Done
- All acceptance criteria are met and validated
- Orchestration service is deployed to staging environment
- Load testing validates concurrent search handling capability
- Monitoring dashboard is functional and tracking metrics
- Unit tests cover all orchestration scenarios (>90% coverage)
- Integration tests verify end-to-end search workflows
- Code is reviewed and approved
- Documentation is complete

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Search state management and lifecycle transitions
- Job queue operations and concurrency control
- Progress tracking accuracy and real-time updates
- Result aggregation and deduplication logic
- Search cancellation and timeout handling
- Retry mechanism effectiveness
- Caching performance and consistency

### Integration Tests
- Query generation service integration
- Contact extraction pipeline coordination
- External search API interactions
- Database operations for search state and results
- Progress tracking system integration
- Error handling across service boundaries

### Performance Tests
- Concurrent search handling (50+ searches)
- Search completion time under 30 seconds
- Memory and CPU usage under peak load
- Job queue throughput and efficiency
- Caching performance improvements

### E2E Tests
- Complete search workflow from start to finish
- Search cancellation and restart scenarios
- Error recovery and fallback mechanisms
- Progress tracking and user notification workflows

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines
- Use existing job queue patterns from the codebase
- Implement proper state management for search lifecycle
- Follow established error handling and retry patterns
- Use existing monitoring and logging frameworks

### Best Practices
- Implement comprehensive search state auditing
- Use efficient serialization for search state storage
- Implement proper resource cleanup for cancelled searches
- Use circuit breaker patterns for external service calls

### Security Considerations
- Implement proper access control for search operations
- Secure search state and result storage
- Implement rate limiting for search initiation
- Audit logging for all search activities

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize job queue processing for throughput
- Implement efficient result aggregation algorithms
- Use connection pooling for database operations
- Optimize search state storage and retrieval
