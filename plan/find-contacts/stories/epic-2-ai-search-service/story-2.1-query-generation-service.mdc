# Story 2.1: Query Generation Service
**Epic**: Epic 2: AI Search Service
**Estimated Time**: 2 days
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Pending
**Assignee**: Backend Developer

## Objective
Implement an intelligent query generation service that creates targeted search queries based on user-defined criteria including countries, categories, beats, and specific topics. The service should generate diverse, relevant queries that maximize the likelihood of finding high-quality media contacts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Query generation algorithm produces relevant search queries for all input criteria
- [ ] Generated queries include country-specific variations and localizations
- [ ] Query diversity ensures comprehensive coverage of potential sources
- [ ] Query scoring and ranking system identifies most promising searches
- [ ] Deduplication prevents redundant or overlapping searches
- [ ] Fallback query strategies handle edge cases and insufficient criteria
- [ ] Query effectiveness improves over time through performance tracking
- [ ] A/B testing framework enables query optimization
- [ ] Query generation time is <1 second per batch
- [ ] Service handles up to 100 concurrent query generation requests

## Technical Requirements

### Core Features
- **Query Template Engine**: Manages country-specific, category-based, and beat-specific query templates
- **AI-Powered Query Enhancement**: Uses AI models to expand and optimize base queries
- **Query Scoring Algorithm**: Ranks queries by relevance, specificity, and potential success rate
- **Deduplication System**: Identifies and removes redundant queries
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks query effectiveness and search success rates
- **Fallback Strategies**: Provides alternative query approaches for edge cases

### Integration Points
- External AI APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic) for query enhancement
- Database for query templates and performance data
- Search orchestration service for query execution
- Monitoring system for performance tracking

### Dependencies
- Epic 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (Database schema, API infrastructure)
- External AI service integration (Task 1.3)

## Definition of Done
- All acceptance criteria are met and validated
- Query generation service is deployed to staging environment
- Algorithm performance is validated with test datasets
- Unit tests cover all query generation scenarios (>90% coverage)
- Integration tests verify end-to-end functionality
- Performance benchmarks are achieved
- Monitoring dashboard is functional
- Code is reviewed and approved
- Documentation is complete

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Query template engine functionality
- AI query enhancement algorithms
- Query scoring and ranking logic
- Deduplication system accuracy
- Fallback strategy effectiveness
- Performance under various load conditions

### Integration Tests
- External AI API integration
- Database operations for templates and metrics
- Search orchestration service integration
- Error handling and recovery scenarios

### Performance Tests
- Query generation time under 1 second
- Concurrent request handling (100+ requests)
- Memory usage under peak load
- Scalability with increasing query complexity

### E2E Tests
- Complete query generation workflow
- A/B testing framework functionality
- Performance tracking and reporting
- User feedback integration

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines
- Use existing AI service integrations from Epic 1
- Implement caching for query templates and performance data
- Follow existing error handling patterns
- Use TypeScript with strict typing for all components

### Best Practices
- Implement comprehensive logging for query generation pipeline
- Use circuit breaker pattern for external AI API calls
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Follow existing database schema patterns

### Security Considerations
- Validate all user input to prevent injection attacks
- Secure API keys and credentials for external services
- Implement rate limiting for query generation requests
- Log all query generation activities for audit trails

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize query template loading and caching
- Implement efficient deduplication algorithms
- Use connection pooling for database operations
- Monitor and optimize memory usage for large query batches
