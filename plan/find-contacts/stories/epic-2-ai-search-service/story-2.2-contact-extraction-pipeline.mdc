# Story 2.2: Contact Extraction Pipeline
**Epic**: Epic 2: AI Search Service
**Estimated Time**: 4 days
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Pending
**Assignee**: Backend Developer

## Objective
Implement an AI-powered contact extraction pipeline that identifies, validates, and extracts contact information from web content with high accuracy. The pipeline should include confidence scoring, duplicate detection, and quality assessment to ensure only high-quality contacts are added to the database.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Contact extraction accuracy >80% on test datasets
- [ ] Email validation catches >95% of invalid email addresses
- [ ] Confidence scores accurately reflect actual data quality
- [ ] Duplicate detection reduces false positives by >90%
- [ ] Social media profile detection accuracy >75%
- [ ] Content quality assessment filters low-quality sources
- [ ] Extraction pipeline processes content in <5 seconds per source
- [ ] Caching reduces processing time by >40% for repeated content
- [ ] Verification system improves overall data quality
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages malformed content

## Technical Requirements

### Core Features
- **Web Content Parser**: Extracts and normalizes content from various web sources
- **AI Contact Identification**: Uses machine learning models to identify contact information
- **Email Validation System**: Validates and verifies email addresses
- **Social Media Detection**: Identifies social media profiles and handles
- **Confidence Scoring Algorithm**: Calculates quality scores for extracted contacts
- **Duplicate Detection System**: Identifies and manages duplicate contacts
- **Content Quality Assessment**: Evaluates source credibility and relevance
- **Extraction Caching**: Caches processed content for efficiency

### Integration Points
- External AI APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic) for contact identification
- Firecrawl service for web content extraction
- Database for contact storage and validation
- Search orchestration service for workflow management
- Verification services for email and social media validation

### Dependencies
- Story 2.1: Query Generation Service
- Epic 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (Database schema, API infrastructure)
- External AI service integration (Task 1.3)

- Implement progressive enhancement for contact identification
- Use ensemble methods for confidence scoring
- Implement proper content sanitization and validation

### Security Considerations
- Validate and sanitize all web content to prevent XSS attacks
- Secure handling of PII and sensitive contact information
- Implement rate limiting for external service calls
- Audit logging for all contact extraction activities

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize AI model calls through batching and caching
- Implement efficient content parsing algorithms
- Use connection pooling for database operations
- Optimize duplicate detection through indexing and hashing
