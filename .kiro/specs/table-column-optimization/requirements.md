# Table Column Optimization Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to optimize table column layouts and improve visual balance across all data tables in the application. Currently, table columns have suboptimal ordering, inconsistent widths, and poor space utilization that impacts user experience. This optimization will improve information hierarchy, visual balance, and responsive behavior while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Optimize Column Order for Information Hierarchy

**User Story:** As a user, I want table columns to be ordered by importance and logical flow so that I can quickly find the most relevant information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view any data table THEN the system SHALL order columns by information priority (primary entity, geographic scope, relationships, metrics, actions)
2. WHEN I view the Publishers table THEN the system SHALL display Countries in the second column position for better visibility
3. WHEN I view tables with geographic data THEN the system SHALL prioritize Countries/Regions columns early in the layout
4. WHEN I scan table data THEN the system SHALL present relationship data (Publisher, Categories) in logical positions
5. WHEN I need to take actions THEN the system SHALL always place Actions column last for consistency

### Requirement 2: Improve Column Width Distribution

**User Story:** As a user, I want table columns to have appropriate widths so that content is displayed clearly without truncation or wasted space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view Countries columns THEN the system SHALL provide sufficient width for flag emoji + country code badges
2. WHEN I view Outlets columns THEN the system SHALL allocate adequate space for outlet name badges and overflow indicators
3. WHEN I view Website columns THEN the system SHALL use compact but readable width for URL display
4. WHEN I view Categories columns THEN the system SHALL provide space for color indicators and category names
5. WHEN I view Contact count columns THEN the system SHALL use compact centered display for numeric badges
6. WHEN content exceeds column width THEN the system SHALL handle overflow with tooltips and truncation consistently

### Requirement 3: Enhance Visual Balance and Spacing

**User Story:** As a user, I want tables to have balanced visual layout so that information is easy to scan and aesthetically pleasing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view any table THEN the system SHALL distribute column widths proportionally to content importance
2. WHEN I view badge collections THEN the system SHALL provide consistent spacing and alignment
3. WHEN I view table headers THEN the system SHALL align content appropriately (left, center, right) based on data type
4. WHEN I view table rows THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent vertical alignment across all columns
5. WHEN I view empty states THEN the system SHALL display them consistently across all column types

### Requirement 4: Standardize Badge Display Patterns

**User Story:** As a user, I want badges and indicators to be displayed consistently so that I can quickly understand data relationships and counts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view country badges THEN the system SHALL display flag emoji + country code in consistent format
2. WHEN I view category badges THEN the system SHALL show color indicators with consistent sizing
3. WHEN I view count badges THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling and positioning
4. WHEN badge collections exceed display limits THEN the system SHALL show overflow indicators with tooltips
5. WHEN I hover over badges THEN the system SHALL provide consistent tooltip information

### Requirement 5: Improve Responsive Table Behavior

**User Story:** As a user, I want tables to work well on different screen sizes so that I can access information on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view tables on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL prioritize most important columns
2. WHEN I view tables on tablet devices THEN the system SHALL optimize column distribution for medium screens
3. WHEN I resize browser windows THEN the system SHALL adapt column widths gracefully
4. WHEN columns don't fit THEN the system SHALL provide horizontal scrolling with sticky actions column
5. WHEN I interact with tables on touch devices THEN the system SHALL maintain usable touch targets

### Requirement 6: Maintain Consistent Search and Filter Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want search functionality to work seamlessly with optimized table layouts so that filtering remains effective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I search table content THEN the system SHALL include all visible column data in search scope
2. WHEN I filter by countries THEN the system SHALL highlight matches in the Countries column effectively
3. WHEN I search for categories THEN the system SHALL match against category names and descriptions
4. WHEN I search for publishers THEN the system SHALL include publisher names in search results
5. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain optimized column layout

### Requirement 7: Enhance Table Header Information

**User Story:** As a user, I want table headers to provide clear information about column content and data counts so that I understand what I'm viewing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view table headers THEN the system SHALL display descriptive column names with appropriate count badges
2. WHEN I view sortable columns THEN the system SHALL indicate sort capability consistently
3. WHEN I view column headers THEN the system SHALL align header text appropriately with column content
4. WHEN I view count badges in headers THEN the system SHALL update them dynamically with filtered results
5. WHEN I view table headers on small screens THEN the system SHALL abbreviate appropriately while maintaining clarity

### Requirement 8: Optimize Content Display Patterns

**User Story:** As a user, I want table content to be displayed in the most readable and scannable format so that I can efficiently process information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view primary entity names THEN the system SHALL display them prominently with consistent typography
2. WHEN I view secondary information THEN the system SHALL use appropriate text hierarchy and muted colors
3. WHEN I view website links THEN the system SHALL format them consistently with external link indicators
4. WHEN I view descriptions THEN the system SHALL truncate appropriately with full text available on hover
5. WHEN I view numeric data THEN the system SHALL align and format consistently for easy comparison

### Requirement 9: Maintain Performance and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want optimized tables to maintain fast performance and accessibility so that the improvements don't impact usability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I interact with optimized tables THEN the system SHALL maintain current performance levels
2. WHEN I use keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL provide consistent tab order across optimized columns
3. WHEN I use screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels for all column content
4. WHEN I view tables with many items THEN the system SHALL render efficiently without performance degradation
5. WHEN I interact with badges and tooltips THEN the system SHALL maintain accessibility compliance

### Requirement 10: Preserve Existing Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want all current table functionality to continue working after optimization so that my workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality
2. WHEN I use dropdown actions THEN the system SHALL continue to work as before
3. WHEN I interact with badges and links THEN the system SHALL maintain current behavior
4. WHEN I search and filter THEN the system SHALL preserve all current capabilities
5. WHEN I refresh tables THEN the system SHALL maintain optimized layout while updating data
