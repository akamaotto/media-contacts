## Objective
Implement real-time progress tracking components that provide clear, informative feedback during AI search execution. These components keep users engaged and informed while searches process in the background, ensuring a transparent and trustworthy experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Progress updates are received in real-time with <2 second delay
- [ ] Progress bar accurately reflects overall search completion percentage
- [ ] Individual progress stages are clearly displayed with current status
- [ ] Time estimation and remaining time display is within ±20% accuracy
- [ ] Search cancellation works within 5 seconds of user request
- [ ] Error messages are clear, actionable, and provide recovery options
- [ ] Progress statistics provide meaningful insights into search performance
- [ ] Offline handling maintains user experience during connection issues
- [ ] Animations are smooth, non-distracting, and performant
- [ ] Sound effects (if implemented) can be disabled by user preference
- [ ] Component is fully accessible to screen readers with proper ARIA labels
- [ ] Progress state persists across page refreshes and browser sessions
- [ ] Multiple concurrent searches can be tracked independently

## Technical Requirements

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines
- Implement proper WebSocket connection management
- Use React Query for caching and synchronization
- Follow reactive programming patterns for real-time updates
- Implement proper cleanup for WebSocket connections
- Use CSS animations with GPU acceleration

### Best Practices
- Implement optimistic updates for perceived performance
- Use proper error boundaries for component isolation
- Implement proper loading states for all async operations
- Follow consistent animation timing and easing functions
- Use semantic HTML and proper ARIA attributes

### Security Considerations
- Secure WebSocket connections with WSS
- Validate incoming progress data for security
- Implement proper CSRF protection for API calls
- Rate limiting for progress update requests
- Audit logging for progress tracking activities

### Performance Considerations
- Debounce rapid progress updates to prevent UI thrashing
- Implement efficient state management for progress data
- Use virtual scrolling for long progress histories
- Optimize animations for 60fps performance
- Implement proper memory cleanup for connections

## Component Specifications

### SearchProgress
```typescript
interface SearchProgressProps {
  searchId: string;
  stages: ProgressStage[];
  overallProgress: number;
  estimatedTimeRemaining: number;
  status: 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'cancelled';
  onCancel: () => void;
  onRetry: () => void;
}
```

### ProgressStage
```typescript
interface ProgressStage {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  progress: number;
  startTime?: Date;
  endTime?: Date;
  metrics?: StageMetrics;
  error?: ErrorInfo;
}

interface ProgressStageProps {
  stage: ProgressStage;
  isCurrent: boolean;
  expanded?: boolean;
  onToggleExpanded?: () => void;
}
```

### ProgressStats
```typescript
interface ProgressStatsProps {
  searchId: string;
  metrics: {
    totalQueries: number;
    completedQueries: number;
    foundContacts: number;

    averageTimePerQuery: number;
  };
  showDetails?: boolean;
}
```

## Real-time Data Flow

```typescript
// Progress update events
interface ProgressUpdateEvent {
  searchId: string;
  stageId: string;
  progress: number;
  metrics?: StageMetrics;
}

// Stage completion events
interface StageCompleteEvent {
  searchId: string;
  stageId: string;
  status: 'completed' | 'failed';
  result?: any;
  error?: string;
}

// Search completion events
interface SearchCompleteEvent {
  searchId: string;
  status: 'completed' | 'failed' | 'cancelled';
  totalResults: number;
  processingTime: number;
}
```

### State Management
- React Query for caching progress data
- WebSocket context for connection management
- Local state for UI interactions and animations
