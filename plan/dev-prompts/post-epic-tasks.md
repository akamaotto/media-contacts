# Post-Epic Tasks: Completeness, QA, and Deployment Automation

## Purpose
This comprehensive prompt handles all post-development tasks for an epic, including completeness checks, parity validation, QA testing, bug fixes, gap completion, and automated deployment workflows.

## Usage
Run this prompt when you have completed all stories in an epic and need to:
- Validate epic completeness and parity
- Perform comprehensive QA testing
- Fix any identified bugs or gaps
- Automate git operations and deployment
- Create pull requests for review

## Input Parameters
- **epic_folder_path**: Path to the epic folder containing stories (e.g., "plan/{feature}/stories/epic-1-foundation-infrastructure")
- **feature_branch**: Base feature branch name (e.g., "feature/{feature-name}")
- **epic_number**: The epic number for consistent naming (e.g., "1")
- **epic_name**: The epic name for reference (e.g., "foundation-infrastructure")
- **feature_path**: Path to the feature planning directory (e.g., "plan/{feature}")

## Output Workflow

### Phase 1: Epic Analysis and Validation

#### 1.1 Story Discovery and Completeness Check
- [ ] **Inventory all stories** in the epic folder
- [ ] **Validate story structure** matches expected format
- [ ] **Check for missing stories** based on implementation-tasks.mdc
- [ ] **Verify story metadata** (status, assignee, priority, estimated time)
- [ ] **Cross-reference dependencies** between stories
- [ ] **Check task-tracker.md** for epic status and story completion

#### 1.2 Parity Validation
- [ ] **Compare stories against implementation tasks** ensuring 100% coverage
- [ ] **Validate technical specifications** alignment
- [ ] **Check API contract coverage** across all stories
- [ ] **Verify database schema completeness** if applicable
- [ ] **Ensure testing strategy coverage** for all components

#### 1.3 Quality Assurance Analysis
- [ ] **Review acceptance criteria** specificity and measurability
- [ ] **Validate technical requirements** completeness
- [ ] **Check testing requirements** thoroughness
- [ ] **Verify definition of done** clarity and achievability
- [ ] **Assess story sizing** and complexity distribution

### Phase 2: Implementation Validation

#### 2.1 Code Completeness Check
```bash
# Find all story implementation files
find . -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" | grep -E "(story|epic)" | head -20

# Check for test files
find . -name "*.test.ts" -o -name "*.test.tsx" -o -name "*.spec.ts" | grep -E "(story|epic)" | head -20

# Verify database migrations exist (if applicable)
ls -la prisma/migrations/ | grep -E "({feature}|epic|story)"

# Check API routes implementation (if applicable)
ls -la src/app/api/ | grep -E "({feature}|ai|search|epic)"
```

#### 2.2 Testing Coverage Validation
```bash
# Run unit tests for the epic
npm test -- --testPathPattern="story|epic|{feature-specific}" --coverage

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration -- --testPathPattern="{feature-specific}"

# Run E2E tests if applicable
npm run test:e2e -- --spec="{feature-specific}"
```

#### 2.3 Database and Migration Validation (if applicable)
```bash
# Check database schema changes
npx prisma db pull
npx prisma generate

# Validate migration files
npx prisma migrate deploy --preview-feature

# Test database in staging
npm run db:validate
