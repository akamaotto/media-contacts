# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the current home page from displaying Media Contacts directly into a comprehensive dashboard that provides key insights, metrics, and activity feeds for the media relations platform. The dashboard will serve as the central command center for users to understand their media database performance, relationships, and recent activities. Additionally, the Media Contacts functionality will be moved to its own dedicated page for better information architecture.
