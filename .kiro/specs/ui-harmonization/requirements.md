# UI Harmonization Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to harmonize the user interface patterns and file structure across all feature components in the application. Currently, there are inconsistencies between different features - some use Sheets for add/edit operations while others use Dialogs/Modals. Additionally, file naming conventions are inconsistent. This harmonization will improve maintainability, user experience, and developer experience by establishing consistent patterns across all features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Standardize UI Components to Sheets

**User Story:** As a user, I want all add/edit operations to use the same UI pattern (sheets) so that I have a consistent experience across all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open any add/edit form THEN the system SHALL display it in a Sheet component (not Dialog/Modal)
2. WHEN I interact with add/edit forms across different features THEN the system SHALL provide consistent behavior and appearance
3. WHEN I use keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL respond consistently across all add/edit forms
4. IF a feature currently uses Dialog/Modal THEN the system SHALL convert it to use Sheet components
5. WHEN I resize the browser window THEN all sheets SHALL respond consistently with standardized widths

### Requirement 2: Standardize File Naming Conventions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent file naming conventions so that I can easily locate and understand component purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I look for add/edit components THEN the system SHALL use consistent naming pattern `*-sheet.tsx`
2. WHEN components use Sheet UI THEN the file names SHALL reflect this with `*-sheet.tsx` suffix
3. WHEN I import components THEN the component names SHALL match their UI implementation (Sheet vs Modal)
4. IF a file is named `*-modal.tsx` but uses Sheet UI THEN the system SHALL rename it to `*-sheet.tsx`
5. WHEN old modal files are converted THEN the system SHALL mark them for removal after testing

### Requirement 3: Harmonize Table Component Patterns

**User Story:** As a user, I want all data tables to have consistent search, filtering, and action patterns so that I can efficiently work with data across different features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view any data table THEN the system SHALL provide consistent search input positioning and styling
2. WHEN I search within tables THEN the system SHALL use consistent placeholder text patterns
3. WHEN I access table actions THEN the system SHALL provide dropdown menus consistently positioned on the right
4. WHEN tables are empty THEN the system SHALL display consistent empty state messages
5. WHEN tables are loading THEN the system SHALL show consistent loading indicators
6. WHEN I view table headers THEN the system SHALL display count badges consistently
7. IF a table uses individual action buttons THEN the system SHALL convert to dropdown menu pattern

### Requirement 4: Standardize Sheet Layout and Behavior

**User Story:** As a user, I want all sheets to have consistent sizing, layout, and behavior so that I can predict how they will function.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open a simple form sheet THEN the system SHALL use width `w-full sm:max-w-md`
2. WHEN I open a complex form sheet THEN the system SHALL use width `w-full sm:max-w-2xl`
3. WHEN sheet content exceeds viewport height THEN the system SHALL enable `overflow-y-auto`
4. WHEN I interact with sheet forms THEN the system SHALL provide consistent padding and spacing
5. WHEN I submit forms THEN the system SHALL show consistent loading states and button behavior
6. WHEN sheets have validation errors THEN the system SHALL display them consistently
7. WHEN I close sheets THEN the system SHALL behave consistently across all features

### Requirement 5: Update Import References and Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all import references to be updated when components are renamed so that the application continues to function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are renamed THEN the system SHALL update all import statements
2. WHEN I build the application THEN the system SHALL not have any broken import references
3. WHEN components are converted THEN the system SHALL update component instantiation in parent components
4. WHEN old files are marked for removal THEN the system SHALL ensure no active references remain
5. WHEN testing new implementations THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality

### Requirement 6: Maintain Feature Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing functionality to continue working after the harmonization so that my workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality
2. WHEN I submit forms THEN the system SHALL process data correctly as before
3. WHEN I interact with tables THEN the system SHALL maintain all filtering and search capabilities
4. WHEN I navigate between features THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent state management
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them consistently across all features
6. WHEN I use keyboard shortcuts THEN the system SHALL respond consistently across all sheets

### Requirement 7: Implement Consistent Form Patterns

**User Story:** As a user, I want all forms to follow consistent validation, submission, and error handling patterns so that I can predict how they will behave.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit invalid forms THEN the system SHALL display validation errors consistently
2. WHEN forms are submitting THEN the system SHALL show loading states consistently
3. WHEN I cancel form operations THEN the system SHALL handle cleanup consistently
4. WHEN forms have optional fields THEN the system SHALL indicate them consistently
5. WHEN I interact with form controls THEN the system SHALL provide consistent styling and behavior
6. WHEN forms have complex inputs (selects, checkboxes) THEN the system SHALL implement them consistently

### Requirement 8: Ensure Responsive Design Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want all sheets and tables to work consistently across different screen sizes so that I can use the application on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view sheets on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt consistently
2. WHEN I view tables on small screens THEN the system SHALL handle overflow consistently
3. WHEN I resize the browser THEN all components SHALL respond predictably
4. WHEN I use touch interactions THEN the system SHALL respond consistently across all sheets
5. WHEN content doesn't fit THEN the system SHALL handle scrolling consistently
