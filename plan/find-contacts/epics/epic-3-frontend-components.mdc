# Epic 3: Frontend Components

## Epic Overview
**Objective**: Implement a comprehensive, responsive, and accessible user interface for the AI-powered contact discovery feature that provides seamless user experience from search configuration to results management.

**Business Value**: This epic delivers the user-facing interface that enables users to easily configure AI searches, monitor progress in real-time, and manage discovered contacts efficiently. A well-designed UI is critical for user adoption and productivity gains.

**Success Metrics**:
- User task completion rate >90%
- Average time to complete search workflow <3 minutes
- User satisfaction score >4.5/5
- Mobile usage rate >40%
- Accessibility compliance WCAG 2.1 AA

## Epic Boundaries

### In Scope
- Modal-based search interface with form validation
- Real-time progress tracking with visual feedback
- Results display with sorting, filtering, and bulk operations
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Accessibility features (screen readers, keyboard navigation)
- Contact preview and import functionality
- Integration with existing design system (ShadCN UI)

### Out of Scope
- Advanced analytics dashboard (covered in Epic 5)
- User preference management (covered in Epic 5)
- Multi-language support (future consideration)
- Advanced reporting features (future consideration)
- Custom theme system (future consideration)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can configure AI searches through intuitive modal interface
- [ ] Real-time progress tracking provides clear feedback during search execution
- [ ] Results display handles 1000+ contacts with smooth performance
- [ ] Interface is fully responsive and works on all device sizes
- [ ] All components meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- [ ] Form validation provides helpful, real-time feedback
- [ ] Bulk operations (selection, import, export) work efficiently
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully with clear recovery options
- [ ] Loading states provide appropriate user feedback
- [ ] Integration with backend APIs is seamless and reliable

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Epic 1: Foundation & Infrastructure must be complete
- Epic 2: AI Search Service APIs must be functional
- Design system components (ShadCN UI) must be available
- API authentication and middleware must be configured

### Blockers
- None identified - all dependencies are within project control

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Performance with large datasets**: Virtual scrolling and efficient rendering needed
  - *Mitigation*: Implement React Virtual, use efficient data structures, test with 10k+ records
- **Real-time update complexity**: WebSocket/Server-Sent Events integration challenges
  - *Mitigation*: Start with polling, upgrade to WebSocket, implement proper error handling
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: CSS Grid/Flexbox inconsistencies
  - *Mitigation*: Use progressive enhancement, test on target browsers, have fallbacks

### Business Risks
- **User adoption curve**: Complex interface may intimidate users
  - *Mitigation*: Intuitive design, onboarding tooltips, progressive disclosure of features
- **Mobile experience degradation**: Complex features may not work well on small screens
  - *Mitigation*: Mobile-first design, simplified mobile interface, thorough mobile testing

### User Experience Risks
- **Accessibility compliance**: Missing accessibility features could exclude users
  - *Mitigation*: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing, screen reader testing, keyboard navigation testing
- **Performance perception**: Slow UI could frustrate users
  - *Mitigation*: Optimistic updates, loading states, performance monitoring

## Timeline and Estimation
**Estimated Duration**: 9 days (3 stories across 2 weeks)
**Key Milestones**:
- Day 3: Modal and form components complete
- Day 5: Progress tracking components complete
- Day 9: Results display components complete

**Resource Requirements**:
- Frontend Developer (100% allocation)
- UX Designer consultation (20% allocation)
- Accessibility testing (QA Engineer, 10% allocation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All three stories are complete and integrated
- [ ] Epic acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness tested on iOS and Android
- [ ] Accessibility testing passes WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (60fps scrolling, <200ms interactions)
- [ ] Integration with Epic 2 APIs is functional
- [ ] Unit tests cover all component states (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests verify user workflows
- [ ] Documentation is complete (component docs, usage examples)
- [ ] Stakeholder approval obtained

- React Query for server state and caching
- Custom hooks for complex state logic

### Integration Points
- Epic 2 AI Search APIs
- Existing authentication system
- Current media contacts database
- Design system components and theming

## User Experience Flow

1. **Search Initiation**: User opens modal and configures search parameters
2. **Validation**: Real-time form validation guides user input
3. **Search Execution**: User submits search and sees progress tracking
4. **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time updates show search stages and ETA
5. **Results Review**: User examines discovered contacts with filtering options
6. **Contact Management**: User selects, previews, and imports desired contacts
7. **Workflow Completion**: User confirms import and returns to main application

## Performance Requirements

### Response Times
- Modal open: <100ms
- Form interactions: <50ms
- Progress updates: <2s delay
- Results rendering: <200ms for 1000 contacts
