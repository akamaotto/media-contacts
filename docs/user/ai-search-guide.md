# AI Search User Guide

This guide helps users understand and effectively use the AI-powered contact search feature in the Media Contacts platform.

## Overview

The AI Search feature uses advanced artificial intelligence to help you find media contacts quickly and accurately. Instead of traditional keyword matching, AI Search understands natural language queries and finds contacts based on meaning, context, and relationships.

## Getting Started

### What is AI Search?

AI Search is an intelligent search system that:
- Understands natural language queries
- Finds contacts based on meaning, not just keywords
- Suggests related contacts and topics
- Learns from your search patterns
- Provides contextually relevant results

### How to Access AI Search

1. **From the Dashboard**: Click the "AI Search" button in the main navigation
2. **From Contacts Page**: Use the AI-powered search bar at the top of the contacts list
3. **Quick Access**: Press `Ctrl+K` (or `Cmd+K` on Mac) anywhere in the application

## Basic Search

### Simple Queries

Start with natural language queries like you're talking to a research assistant:

```
Find technology journalists in New York
Show me fashion bloggers who cover sustainability
I need contacts in renewable energy sector
Sports writers for major newspapers
```

### Search Tips

- **Be Specific**: More specific queries give better results
- **Use Natural Language**: Write queries as you would speak
- **Include Context**: Mention topics, locations, or publication types
- **Try Variations**: Different phrasing can yield different results

### Example Searches

| Query | What it Finds |
|-------|---------------|
