/**
 * Geography type definitions
 * 
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT: Static geography data (regions, countries) has been removed as part of the static content cleanup.
 * All geography data should now come from the database.
 * 
 * üìç For type definitions, import from: @/lib/types/geography
 * üîß For database operations, use the functions in:
 * - @/backend/regions/actions
 * - @/backend/countries/actions
 * - @/backend/languages/actions
 * 
 * Migration guide:
 * - Old: import { regions, countries } from '@/lib/country-data'
 * - New: import { getAllRegions } from '@/backend/regions/actions'
 * - New: import { getCountries } from '@/backend/countries/actions'
