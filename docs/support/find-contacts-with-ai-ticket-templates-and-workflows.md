Dear [USER_NAME],

Thank you for contacting us about the "Find Contacts with AI" issue you're experiencing. 
I understand you're having trouble with [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION_OF_ISSUE].

I'm here to help you resolve this quickly. To get started, I'd like to ask a few questions:

In the meantime, please try these quick troubleshooting steps:

#### Template 1.2: Performance Issue
```
Subject: Re: Slow Search Performance - Ticket #[TICKET_NUMBER]

Dear [USER_NAME],

I understand you're experiencing slow performance with "Find Contacts with AI." 
I apologize for the inconvenience this is causing.

Search performance can vary based on several factors:

To help me diagnose the issue:
1. What specific query are you trying?
2. How long have you been waiting for results?
3. Does this happen with all searches or specific ones?
4. What time of day are you typically searching?

Try these optimization tips:
- Use more specific, focused queries
- Reduce the number of filters applied
- Search during off-peak hours (early morning or late evening)
- Try breaking complex searches into multiple simpler ones

I'll investigate potential system issues and get back to you with a solution within [RESPONSE_TIME].
