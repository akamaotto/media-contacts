# Requirements Document for CSV Import/Export

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing robust CSV import and export functionality in the Media Contacts Management System. The system needs to support efficient bulk operations for managing large datasets of media contacts, allowing users to import new contacts from CSV files and export existing contacts to CSV format with customizable options.

The CSV functionality must handle large datasets efficiently, provide clear feedback during operations, validate data integrity, and integrate seamlessly with the existing dashboard interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: CSV Import Functionality

**User Story:** As a media contacts manager, I want to import contacts from CSV files, so that I can efficiently add multiple contacts without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading a CSV file THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and structure before processing
2. WHEN importing contacts THEN the system SHALL map CSV columns to database fields with flexible column mapping
3. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress updates
4. WHEN encountering invalid data THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reports without failing the entire import
5. WHEN duplicate contacts are detected THEN the system SHALL provide options to skip, update, or create new records

### Requirement 2: CSV Export Functionality

**User Story:** As a media contacts manager, I want to export contacts to CSV format, so that I can use the data in other systems or share it with team members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting contacts THEN the system SHALL include all relevant fields in the CSV output
2. WHEN exporting large datasets THEN the system SHALL use streaming to prevent memory issues
3. WHEN initiating an export THEN the system SHALL allow selection of which fields to include
4. WHEN exporting filtered data THEN the system SHALL apply the current filters to the export
5. WHEN downloading the CSV THEN the system SHALL provide a properly formatted file with headers and consistent data formatting

### Requirement 3: User Interface Integration

**User Story:** As a user of the media contacts system, I want intuitive interfaces for import and export operations, so that I can perform these tasks efficiently without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the media contacts dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide clearly visible import and export buttons
2. WHEN uploading a CSV THEN the system SHALL support drag-and-drop and file browser selection
3. WHEN an operation is in progress THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators and status updates
4. WHEN an operation completes THEN the system SHALL provide clear success or error notifications
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display actionable error messages with guidance for resolution

### Requirement 4: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator managing large contact databases, I want CSV operations to perform efficiently with large datasets, so that bulk operations don't cause system slowdowns or failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing files with 10,000+ records THEN the system SHALL complete the operation within 60 seconds
2. WHEN exporting large datasets THEN the system SHALL use streaming to prevent memory exhaustion
3. WHEN multiple users perform CSV operations simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain responsiveness
4. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL use chunking and batch processing to optimize performance
5. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities to prevent partial data corruption

### Requirement 5: Security and Data Validation

**User Story:** As a security-conscious organization, I want CSV operations to maintain data integrity and security, so that bulk operations don't introduce vulnerabilities or corrupt data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing CSV files THEN the system SHALL validate data against defined schemas before insertion
2. WHEN processing user-uploaded files THEN the system SHALL implement proper sanitization to prevent injection attacks
3. WHEN performing bulk operations THEN the system SHALL maintain audit logs of all changes
4. WHEN importing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL enforce the same access controls as manual entry
5. WHEN validating data THEN the system SHALL enforce the same business rules and constraints as the UI
