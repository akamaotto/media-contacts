### Monitoring Dashboard
- **Key Performance Indicators**: Search success rate, response time, error rate
- **User Metrics**: Feature adoption, usage patterns, user satisfaction
- **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, database performance, API costs
- **Business Metrics**: Contact discovery rate, user time savings, ROI
- **Alert Thresholds**: Configurable alerts for critical metrics

### Launch Strategy
1. **Internal Testing**: Feature enabled for internal team only
2. **Beta Release**: Feature enabled for select customers (5-10%)
3. **Limited Rollout**: Feature enabled for larger group (25-50%)
4. **Full Rollout**: Feature enabled for all users
5. **Post-launch**: Continuous monitoring and optimization

### Communication Plan
- **Pre-launch**: Internal team communication and training
- **Beta Launch**: Communication to beta testers with feedback channels
- **Limited Rollout**: Announcement to affected users with support information
- **Full Launch**: Public announcement with comprehensive launch materials
- **Post-launch**: Regular updates on feature performance and improvements
