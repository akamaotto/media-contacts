## Testing Requirements

### API Integration Tests
- **Search Endpoint**: `/api/ai/search` with various query parameters
- **Progress Endpoint**: Real-time progress updates via WebSocket/SSE
- **Results Endpoint**: Search result retrieval and pagination
- **Import Endpoint**: Contact import functionality
- **Export Endpoint**: Search result export functionality

### Database Integration Tests
- **Search Operations**: Query generation and execution
- **Data Persistence**: Saving search results and user preferences
- **Data Retrieval**: Contact information lookup and filtering
- **Transaction Management**: Complex operations with multiple steps
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring data integrity across operations

### External Service Integration Tests
- **OpenAI Integration**: Query enhancement and content analysis
- **Anthropic Integration**: Fallback AI processing
- **Exa Search Integration**: Web search functionality
- **Firecrawl Integration**: Web content extraction
- **Error Handling**: Service failures and recovery mechanisms

### Real-time Integration Tests
- **WebSocket Connections**: Connection establishment and maintenance
- **Server-Sent Events**: Progress updates and notifications
- **Connection Management**: Handling disconnections and reconnections
- **Message Broadcasting**: Multi-client scenarios
- **Performance**: Concurrent connection handling

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines
- Use realistic test data that mirrors production scenarios
- Implement proper test isolation to prevent test interference
- Use actual database for integration tests (not in-memory)
- Mock external services but maintain realistic response patterns
- Test both success and failure scenarios

### Test Structure Examples
```javascript
describe('AI Search API Integration', () => {
  describe('POST /api/ai/search', () => {
    it('should process search request and return results', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const searchRequest = {
        criteria: { country: 'US', category: 'technology' },
        options: { maxResults: 10 }
      };

      // Act
      const response = await request(app)
        .post('/api/ai/search')
        .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${userToken}`)
        .send(searchRequest);

      // Assert
      expect(response.status).toBe(200);
      expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('searchId');
      expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('status', 'processing');
    });
  });
});
```

### Test Data Management
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Use data that resembles real-world usage
- **Edge Cases**: Test with unusual but possible data combinations
- **Performance Scenarios**: Test with large datasets and complex queries
- **Cleanup Procedures**: Ensure proper cleanup after each test
- **State Management**: Maintain consistent test state across test runs

### Mock Strategy for External Services
- **Realistic Responses**: Mock responses that match actual service behavior
- **Error Scenarios**: Simulate various failure modes
- **Rate Limiting**: Test handling of rate-limited responses
- **Timeout Scenarios**: Test handling of slow or non-responsive services
- **Data Validation**: Ensure mock data is properly formatted

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize test execution time with proper mocking strategies
- Use parallel test execution where safe
- Implement efficient test data setup and cleanup
- Monitor test execution times and identify bottlenecks
- Use test coverage to ensure comprehensive testing without redundancy
